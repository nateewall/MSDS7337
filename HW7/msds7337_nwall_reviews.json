It had amazing plotting, a satisfying ending, a terrifying villain, characters that I loved, nothing superfluous, beautiful cinematography and tone. It delivered on every promise that it made. \\n\\nI could not wait for Season 2. And those two years were tough. Alas it finally arrived. I knew going in that it had a tough act to follow and so I made a concerted effort to judge it on it's own merits and not to dismiss it just for failing to achieve the impossible by living up to the first. \\n\\nWhat went wrong. Plotting: All over the place with little focus. A terrifying villain? Try NO villain. Characters that I love? Yes but the two leads are mostly kept separate from each other for some strange reason. Nothing superfluous? Carrie Ann Moss and her entire sub-plot was boring and irrelevant. Jessica's rival PI was a flat plot device. A satisfying ending? I wouldn't know, I couldn't get past episode 8. It was putting me to sleep. The season did continue to have beautiful cinematography and tone\\/atmosphere, but that gets no points from me if the writing is dull. Nutmeg can make good egg nog great, but it's not appetizing when eaten on it's own. \\n\\nI think the biggest problem with Season 2 is that it fails to deliver on Jessica Jones' core promise: it is a sci-fi super-hero show about a tortured loner who does not want to be a superhero but is, none-the-less, forced to fight super-villains because they are threatening her and the people she loves. \\n\\nIn other words, Season 2 was Jurassic Park without Dinosaurs. \\n\\nI'm giving the show a 5.

The same fiction can not be made for each film. We don't know if Derek Kolstad had thought that John Wick would be this big when he first created it, but when we came to the third film it seems clear how the story deepened and became beautiful.\\n\\nThis film offers you all kinds of action. The film has a unique style of action. Any action you can think of is included in the third film. Moreover, exponentially! The enemies are increasingly jumping. As we saw in the trailer, there is even a horse escape scene. There's so much more to it. At this point, sometimes there can be a small illusion in the viewer. Only action-oriented films can be considered empty. We can say that John Wick 3 offers almost uninterrupted action for 2 hours and 10 minutes. But in doing so, it doesn't forget the story. You will learn new and very interesting details of John Wick and you will get new ideas about the functioning of the universe.\\n\\nStahelski has very impressive shots.The main venues preferred for the main fights were especially appreciated. The fact that the director's vision is so blended with Keanu Reeves and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Stahelski deserves great praise.\\n\\nThe film also brings new characters. One of them is Sofia, played by Halle Berry. Obviously the audience will love Sofia. Halle Berry has done a great job. Mark Dacascos is one of our main villains; He portrayed the character Zero in the film.\\n\\nAmong the action films, it was both a strong story and an ambitious way of action.

But a policeman arriving at the city is looking to stop this family, but it's not easy. It will also be noticeable the segregated fight of ghettos like Italians, gypsies, local gangsters and Jews. Peaky Blinders is an excellent gangster drama full of rich, interesting and diverse characters. The fact that Peaky Blinders is a crime series can give the impression that characters are macho men. But this is not true. The series also incorporates many powerful female characters. It has an excellent cast and script. Thomas is a character who uses his strategic intelligence and applies violence to his own ends without hesitation. The film music is the highlight of the series along with Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy. The director does resort to a modern soundtrack that reflects the fiction.\\n\\nIt is estimated that one episode of the series is worth 1 million and 1.5 million euros. This means a rich, detailed and beautiful work of art. Constantly supporting the narrative structure visually, Peaky Blinders often touches upon the working conditions of the working class in Birmingham. Peaky Blinders, with a color scale that chooses to contrast between pale blues and greens, and contrasts with the shades of red, makes the strongest manifestation of emotions in the midst of this unknown, while attributing a distinct obscurity to Birmingham's misty air. Also, the visual effects used from time to time are quite clever. The visual effects used are also quite compatible with the historical theme of the series.\\n\\nPeaky Blinders makes each episode a separate action and drama.

There has never been a show or a film that came as close to showing what life must have been like in those lawless young towns that got built nearly over night wherever gold was found. A magnet for all kind of fortune seekers (gold diggers, whores, outlaws \\u2013 but also settlers who were just hoping to build a better life), the town of Deadwood was notorious even by the standards of the time. In the show, this \\\"cesspool of vice\\\" is brought back to life with great attention to historical detail. You'll find no romanticised view of pioneers who lived and died by \\\"the code of honour\\\", but real people whose moral standards are \\u2013 in most cases \\u2013 murky at best. And the world they inhabit is a rough, dirty, violent place where only the fiercest \\u2013 and the most cunning \\u2013 survive. \\n\\nAs far as the historical characters depicted in the show are concerned, the writers naturally had to take some liberties (after all, nobody knows exactly who said or did what at the time), but the depiction of the era and the historical background are very accurate. Yet this is not a history lesson; it's an immensely entertaining western-show blessed with some of the best writers and actors working in television and film today \\u2013 and especially the cast of 'Deadwood' really can't get enough praise: there is not a single performance here that isn't excellent. Of course, the one who steals the show is Ian McShane. His Al Swearengen is one of the most morally complex and fun-to-watch characters I've ever seen (and he misses absolutely no opportunity to show you just what the first five letters in \\\"SWEAR-engen\\\" stand for). The power-struggles in Deadwood he is involved in \\u2013 and since he wants to maintain his position at the top of the food-chain he's involved in all of them \\u2013 are equalled in complexity and entertainment value only by those in top-notch shows like 'Game of Thrones', 'House of Cards' or 'Breaking Bad'. And the lengths Al is willing to go to achieve his goals secure him a place in the top ten of \\\"all-time great bad-asses\\\".\\n\\nSo my verdict: While certainly not for the easily offended or those who prefer a \\\"sanitized version\\\" of the old west, 'Deadwood' offers a fascinating look at a time we mostly know from myths and legends and gives us a chance to revisit those and see them from a different angle.

Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. \\n\\nAs far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the \\\"normal\\\", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.\\n\\nSo for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. \\n\\nMy verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.\\n\\nFavorite films: IMDb.com\\/list\\/mkjOKvqlSBs\\/\\n\\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com\\/list\\/ls070242495\\/\\n\\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com\\/list\\/ls054808375\\/\\n\\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com\\/list\\/ls075552387\\/\",\"NP\":[[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"opening\",\"NN\"]],[[\"beautiful\",\"JJ\"],[\"song\",\"NN\"]],[[\"usual\",\"JJ\"],[\"cop\",\"NN\"]],[[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dark\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cinema\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"black\",\"JJ\"],[\"humour\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"slight\",\"JJ\"],[\"psychedelic\",\"NN\"]],[[\"touch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"atmosphere\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"southern\",\"JJ\"],[\"ambiance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"cinematography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"recent\",\"JJ\"],[\"TV-history\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"musical\",\"JJ\"],[\"analogy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"crazy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"creative\",\"JJ\"],[\"energy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"felt\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bluesy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hypnotic\",\"JJ\"],[\"pulse\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"original\",\"JJ\"],[\"music\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"mood\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nothing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"wow\",\"NN\"]],[[\"wow\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"personal\",\"JJ\"],[\"hunger\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"depressed\",\"JJ\"],[\"partner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"ritual\",\"JJ\"],[\"murder\",\"NN\"]],[[\"much\",\"JJ\"],[\"fun\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"moment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"opinion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"single\",\"JJ\"],[\"note\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"writing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"top\",\"JJ\"],[\"notch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"creative\",\"JJ\"],[\"team\",\"NN\"]],[[\"next\",\"JJ\"],[\"'Wire\",\"NN\"]],[[\"quality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"day\",\"NN\"]],[[\"accomplished\",\"JJ\"],[\"director\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"talent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"future\",\"NN\"]],[[\"verdict\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"well\",\"NN\"]],[[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"considerate\",\"JJ\"],[\"pace\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"imdb.com\\/list\\/ls075552387\\/\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\",\"reviewText\":\"I have never one been that big of a fan of the original Law & Order.

Personally, I always watch heist movies and feel bad for the victims, regardless of how truly endangered they are. If your leading man or lady has good intentions, then it becomes easier to watch, but I've never quite had an experience like The Old Man and the Gun before. This is a film that takes its time telling the story at hand and there's hardly ever an exciting moment, but it never feels like it drags. This is (surprisingly) a true story that I believe everyone will get a kick out of and here's why.\\n\\nFollowing Forrest Tucker (Robert Redford) after he has escaped from prison, The Old Man and the Gun is really just about a man who doesn't have many years left in his life and simply wishes to do what makes him happy. Robbing banks in the most polite way that he possibly can, without ever harming anyone, and pretty much always getting away with it, the character of Forrest is absolutely perfect for the way this film portrays him. Whether he's in a high-speed chase to the sound of a calm country song or sitting in a diner with a woman whom he's trying to form a connection with, this is truly one of the most relaxing experiences I think I've ever had at the movies in quite some time.\\n\\nRobert Redford has always been a likable screen presence. Since his early days in movies like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to even small roles in films like Pete's Dragon today, he has always had the charisma to charm his audience. This may very well be his final performance and if that's really the case, I believe he has gone out on a very high note. I don't believe this film isn't going to win any awards or really be nominated for all that much, but in terms of purely enjoying a character on-screen, The Old Man and the Gun delivers on everything you'd expect, and then some.\\n\\nYes, as I said, this is a very calm film, so what's a calm experience without the much-needed elements. For a movie like this, you'd expect a slow score and music that will put you at ease, along with some solid comedy in the moments where he may be going a little too far for his particular characteristics. The film provides all of that and more. There were moments where I felt he was about to go out of character, but then the film either came up with a joke to make you feel comfortable about his choices or played a country song that was so on the nose that it makes you laugh. For as slow as this film is, it never once had me checking my watch. This 90-minute film flies by, even with its slow pace.\\n\\nIn the end, The Old Man and the Gun is the type of film that's very hard to find a complaint about. It has a specific direction and it sticks with it throughout its entire duration. It's about a wanted gentleman who goes under the radar and robs banks, finds love and is continuously hunted by the police (namely a cop played by Casey Affleck, who is also extremely enjoyable in the movie). Look, if you're looking for a complex cops and robbers story, then I would look elsewhere, but if you just want to relax at the movies and have a good time, this is the perfect film for exactly that. The Old Man and the Gun comes highly recommended from me.\",\"NP\":[[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"commit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"smile\",\"NN\"]],[[\"face\",\"NN\"]],[[\"heist\",\"NN\"]],[[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"lady\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"experience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hand\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"exciting\",\"JJ\"],[\"moment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"true\",\"JJ\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"kick\",\"NN\"]],[[\"prison\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"polite\",\"JJ\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"high-speed\",\"JJ\"],[\"chase\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sound\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"calm\",\"JJ\"],[\"country\",\"NN\"]],[[\"song\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"diner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"woman\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"connection\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"likable\",\"JJ\"],[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"presence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"today\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"charisma\",\"NN\"]],[[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"final\",\"JJ\"],[\"performance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"case\",\"NN\"]],[[\"high\",\"JJ\"],[\"note\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"calm\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"calm\",\"JJ\"],[\"experience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"slow\",\"JJ\"],[\"score\",\"NN\"]],[[\"music\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ease\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"solid\",\"JJ\"],[\"comedy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"joke\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"country\",\"NN\"]],[[\"song\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"nose\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"watch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"90-minute\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"slow\",\"JJ\"],[\"pace\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"type\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"complaint\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"specific\",\"JJ\"],[\"direction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"entire\",\"JJ\"],[\"duration\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"wanted\",\"JJ\"],[\"gentleman\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"radar\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"police\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"cop\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"complex\",\"JJ\"],[\"cops\",\"NN\"]],[[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"perfect\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Man\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"NCIS\",\"reviewText\":\"This has become my favorite regular show on the main networks.

Scenery and props look authentic. A couple of the scenes (particularly combat in the bombers) are well realised and tense. It's MUCH better than Mike Nichols' abortive film attempt of 1970.\\n\\nThe less-good: This is definitely NOT Catch-22. This is 'Catch-22 Lite' - a much simpler version in easy-to-understand and easy-to-digest morsels. Nothing too bitter, sharp, complicated or controversial here. Key satirical targets of the book (incompetence - of government administration, security forces, army commanders - the blindness of capitalism, gung-ho patriotism, systemic racism, etc.) are either watered down or omitted. Several key characters are conflated, so they lose their individual characteristics and become bland stereotypes. Other important characters are simply missing. So many story strands are left out that if this was a sock someone would be constantly darning it. The key storyline of Yossarian's significant journey is weakened in places by the lack of those supporting strands.\\n\\nThe book is a blazing and merciless satire filled with devices to make the reader empathise with the emotional and psychological trauma Yossarian is going through (temporal displacement; juxtaposed but dissimilar scenes linked by common dialogue; frighteningly indifferent rules, regulations, administrators; people in positions of corrupting power whose main concern is their own welfare; Kafka-esque terror at the surrender of personal control to unseen powers). This series jettisons most of that and replaces it with a simple chronological story using some of Heller's material where it suits and making up new things where it doesn't (witness the weak but perhaps more socially acceptable revised ending. Ouch!)\\n\\nCasting, directing and screenplay opt for some poor choices here which don't help. Clooney is too old to play Scheisskopf. Laurie could never be the intimidating Major __ de Coverley. Cathcart, Korn, Aarfy, Major Major, McWatt, Nately, Orr and several others neither look nor act like their literary counterparts, weakening the story still further and making them into filler parts.\\n\\nSummary: Catch-22 will always be a major challenge to film, its scope making it all but impossible to realise in a 90-minute movie. However, this is nearly 4.5 hours of TV which dragged in places because the pace was too slow and the story too tightly focused and limiting. In serial form like this it should be much easier to realise something similar in scope, message and power to Heller's extraordinary book. As such, it's rather a wasted opportunity.\",\"NP\":[[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"adaptation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Scenery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"A\",\"DT\"],[\"couple\",\"NN\"]],[[\"combat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"abortive\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"attempt\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"less-good\",\"NN\"]],[[\"version\",\"NN\"]],[[\"easy-to-understand\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"book\",\"NN\"]],[[\"government\",\"NN\"]],[[\"administration\",\"NN\"]],[[\"security\",\"NN\"]],[[\"army\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"blindness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"capitalism\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gung-ho\",\"JJ\"],[\"patriotism\",\"NN\"]],[[\"systemic\",\"JJ\"],[\"racism\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bland\",\"NN\"]],[[\"many\",\"JJ\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"sock\",\"NN\"]],[[\"someone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"key\",\"JJ\"],[\"storyline\",\"NN\"]],[[\"significant\",\"JJ\"],[\"journey\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"lack\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"book\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"blazing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"merciless\",\"NN\"]],[[\"satire\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"reader\",\"NN\"]],[[\"empathise\",\"NN\"]],[[\"psychological\",\"JJ\"],[\"trauma\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Yossarian\",\"NN\"]],[[\"temporal\",\"JJ\"],[\"displacement\",\"NN\"]],[[\"common\",\"JJ\"],[\"dialogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"indifferent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"power\",\"NN\"]],[[\"main\",\"JJ\"],[\"concern\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"welfare\",\"NN\"]],[[\"terror\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"surrender\",\"NN\"]],[[\"personal\",\"JJ\"],[\"control\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"simple\",\"JJ\"],[\"chronological\",\"JJ\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"material\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Casting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"opt\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"filler\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Catch-22\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"major\",\"JJ\"],[\"challenge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"scope\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"90-minute\",\"JJ\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"pace\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"serial\",\"JJ\"],[\"form\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"scope\",\"NN\"]],[[\"message\",\"NN\"]],[[\"power\",\"NN\"]],[[\"extraordinary\",\"JJ\"],[\"book\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"wasted\",\"JJ\"],[\"opportunity\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Warrior\",\"reviewText\":\"This series is really promising.

I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.\\n\\nBreaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.\\n\\nI finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release.

Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it.

Those who might dismiss Endeavour as just another generic addition to an already overcrowded marketplace, however, would be making a grievous error.\\n\\nThe year is 1965 and an eccentric young Detective Constable, Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans), is making waves at the Oxford City Police with not only his unorthodox but brilliant methods of deduction, but for his refusal to tow the line in order to please the upper echelons of both the Force and society. Under the steadfast guidance of the seasoned and similarly incorruptible, Fred Thursday (Roger Allam), Morse finds himself embroiled in a number of complex cases that expose him to the darker side of life and human nature.\\n\\nAlthough the series will naturally draw comparisons to its popular predecessor, thanks to the show's gripping narratives, vibrant swinging sixties backdrop and perfect blend of light and dark overtones, Endeavour is easily able to distinguish itself by its own considerable merits. \\n\\nMuch of the show's success can be attributed to the ingenious casting of Evans, who puts his own unique stamp on the iconic role. Of course there are parallels to the world weary DI so expertly embodied by John Thaw, but Evans wisely avoids imitation, as the twenty-year age difference between the two interpretations allows the actor to create something fresh. The addition of the character of Fred Thursday is inspired. The street wise, war veteran is the perfect mentor for the idealistic Morse and their relationship is one of the highlights of the series.

Watching bad situations get worse as bad decisions lead to even worse ones and the lives of ordinary people spiral violently out of control is - I shamefully admit - a lot of fun to watch, and it's told here with such a wicked sense of humor that I've so far enjoyed every minute of it. \\n\\nThe cast so far has been outstanding (this is an anthology series, so each new season will have its own cast and a new storyline) and the production values - especially the cinematography - are fantastic. Now whether 'Fargo' will appeal to a larger audience despite its quirky characters and non-mainstream look the way a show like 'Breaking Bad' did remains to be seen, but I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys black comedies in general as well as pretty much anything the Coens ever did. Great, pitch black entertainment - 9 out of 10 from me.\\n\\nFavorite Films: http:\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/list\\/ls054200841\\/\\n\\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http:\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/list\\/ls054808375\\/\\n\\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http:\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/list\\/ls070242495\\/\\n\\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http:\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/list\\/ls075552387\\/\",\"NP\":[[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"beast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"only\",\"JJ\"],[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"title\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fake\",\"NN\"]],[[\"premise\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"job\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cult\",\"NN\"]],[[\"status\",\"NN\"]],[[\"control\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fun\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"wicked\",\"JJ\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"humor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"minute\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"cast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"anthology\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"each\",\"DT\"],[\"new\",\"JJ\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"cast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"new\",\"JJ\"],[\"storyline\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"production\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"cinematography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"non-mainstream\",\"JJ\"],[\"look\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"much\",\"JJ\"],[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pitch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"black\",\"JJ\"],[\"entertainment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"http\",\"NN\"]],[[\"http\",\"NN\"]],[[\"http\",\"NN\"]],[[\"http\",\"NN\"]],[[\"\\/\\/www.imdb.com\\/list\\/ls075552387\\/\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Elementary\",\"reviewText\":\"Just finished the season finale season 6 and have been a faithful viewer throughout. I worried that this could be the series finale, and am very grateful it isn't. Keep watching people! What I find brilliant about this series began at the first season. That a character in modern day as sensitive and intelligent as Sherlock would become an addict makes perfect sense if you think about it. And we meet Watson as the unwelcome sober companion former surgeon hired by Sherlock's father to keep him sober who also has an addiction to solving crimes. The development of relationships and character arcs throughout the years has been a delight to watch. The crimes, the interface with the NYPD with great actors (that didn't have enough to do), Aiden Quinn and Jon Michael Hill, and watching them all affect each other through conflicts, betrayals, along with other great actors playing various supporting roles from the incredible idea of a female Moriarty as nemesis, it all seems almost unworkable until it becomes incredibly workable and fascinating. I find I welcome such an inventive version of the classic. I've enjoyed Jonny Lee Miller's work since \\\"Eli Stone,\\\" backtracking his career which got me into British Drama much more. So he is the reason I tuned in to this version, and I love what he's done with the character. His body, the way he holds and moves it, his facial expression, none of which show off his real handsomeness, is amazing. His character is hard to like almost, and the character doesn't care, but does. In this season finale we see a side of Sherlock he hardly ever shows. So much depth and layering of the character that seems like it can keep revealing as he keeps growing. Great writing along with the acting. Lucy Liu who I loved in \\\"Ally McBeal\\\" and have also followed is a great foil and partner to this character as Watson. Both these actors can handle comedy and musical comedy straight. but, sadly, there's not much comedy here. There's little excellent television, especially in American tv. Really good shows get cancelled and tripe gets a following. It's mystifying. This is one of the few really great series available to us. I've watched seasons more than twice and it still holds up as great entertainment, provocative, surprising, in depth, great storytelling. It makes you squirm at times, highly uncomfortable as people go dark, even the heroes. What happens to people when the pain of living with what we do under certain circumstances gets acted out. It's great to have a show taking us into these places with characters that look like they may not make it through it, even break, and where and how recovery happens, how they find their way. There's a real dark twist to Sherlock's recovery in Season 6. All the actors carry it all off extremely well. Well envisioned, directed, set, designed, lit, sound tracked, everything about the series is well done. It doesn't miss a beat.\",\"NP\":[[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"finale\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"faithful\",\"NN\"]],[[\"viewer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"finale\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"modern\",\"JJ\"],[\"day\",\"NN\"]],[[\"perfect\",\"JJ\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"unwelcome\",\"JJ\"],[\"sober\",\"NN\"]],[[\"companion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"former\",\"JJ\"],[\"surgeon\",\"NN\"]],[[\"father\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"addiction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"development\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"arcs\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"delight\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"interface\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"incredible\",\"JJ\"],[\"idea\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nemesis\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fascinating\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"inventive\",\"JJ\"],[\"version\",\"NN\"]],[[\"work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"career\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"reason\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"version\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"body\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"facial\",\"JJ\"],[\"expression\",\"NN\"]],[[\"none\",\"NN\"]],[[\"real\",\"JJ\"],[\"handsomeness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"finale\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"side\",\"NN\"]],[[\"much\",\"JJ\"],[\"depth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"layering\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"revealing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"acting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"foil\",\"NN\"]],[[\"partner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"comedy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"musical\",\"JJ\"],[\"comedy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"straight\",\"NN\"]],[[\"much\",\"JJ\"],[\"comedy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"little\",\"JJ\"],[\"excellent\",\"JJ\"],[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"American\",\"JJ\"],[\"tv\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"following\",\"NN\"]],[[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"entertainment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"depth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"storytelling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"pain\",\"NN\"]],[[\"living\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"recovery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"real\",\"JJ\"],[\"dark\",\"JJ\"],[\"twist\",\"NN\"]],[[\"recovery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"lit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sound\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"beat\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Black Spot\",\"reviewText\":\"Part murder mystery, part supernatural horror, part soap opera.

All of the duo's cases take place in the picturesque yet fictional county of Midsomer which must have the highest death rate anywhere in the world!\\n\\nThis highly popular detective series was first aired on 23 March 1997 when the pilot episode \\\"The Killings At Badgers Drift\\\" was transmitted. ITV announced it as a one off film but it was very successful with figures in the region of 13.5 million viewers, and the film won the Best Drama Award that year. The film was based on the 1987 novel by Caroline Graham which was regarded by the Crime Writers' Association as being one of the Top 100 crime novels of all time. The initial series which followed was based on Graham's other four Inspector Barnaby novels, these were \\\"Written In Blood\\\", \\\"Death Of A Hollow Man\\\", \\\"Death In Disguise\\\" and \\\"Faithful Unto Death\\\". Having filmed the majority of Graham's novels featuring Barnaby (A Place Of Safety & Ghost In The Machine have not been filmed as yet) the producers turned to other writers to provide new stories for the subsequent five series. These have included contributions from prolific and accomplished writers such as Anthony Horowitz (\\\"Agatha Christie's Poirot\\\"), Douglas Watkinson (\\\"The Professionals\\\", \\\"Boon\\\", \\\"Emmerdale\\\") and Christopher Russell (\\\"The Bill\\\", \\\"Cadfael\\\"). In the past six years since it made its debut on British television there has been nearly thirty episodes and there is no hint of the series finishing yet. The series is notable in that it has brought John Nettles back to prime time TV after the \\\"Bergerac\\\" series finished in 1993. In this series he played Sergeant Bergerac, a Jersey copper fighting alcoholism and has had uncomfortable relationships with several girlfriends, a role far removed from that of Inspector Barnaby.\\n\\nThe first episode of the seventh series entitled \\\"The Green Man\\\" was aired on 2 November 2003. Daniel Casey who plays Sergeant Troy has left the series. The character has been promoted to Inspector and is leaving Midsomer to take up a position in Newcastle. John Nettles will have a new sidekick in John Hopkins as Sergeant Scott who will be introduced when the remainder of the series is broadcast in January 2004.\\n\\n\\\"Midsomer Murders\\\" is a wonderful series, although like many long running series, it has occasionally fallen below it's own standard in that the ideas for new plots sometimes becomes strained after so many episodes. The characters are rich and well realised by first class actors and it gets full mileage out of it's rural setting. Guest stars have included Alan Howard (the nephew of Leslie Howard) and Samantha Bond (Miss Moneypenny in all the James Bond films since \\\"Goldeneye\\\"). The quality of this series to my mind is that it should make it to the big screen someday. There would be no need to change anything as all the ingredients for a good cinema feature are there already. These days most of the quality stuff is on the small screen and a lot of mediocre stuff is lumbered on our picture houses.\\n\\nIt has been announced that John Nettles will be quitting the show after playing Inspector Barnaby for twelve-years since the show made its debut. However, he will still be seen in it until 2011 and it looks very much like the show will still continue very much in the manner of other TV shows such as Taggart and McCallam, which carried on without their title characters.\",\"NP\":[[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"respectable\",\"JJ\"],[\"middle-aged\",\"JJ\"],[\"family\",\"NN\"]],[[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"copper\",\"NN\"]],[[\"immature\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"duo\",\"NN\"]],[[\"place\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"picturesque\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fictional\",\"JJ\"],[\"county\",\"NN\"]],[[\"death\",\"NN\"]],[[\"rate\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"popular\",\"JJ\"],[\"detective\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"pilot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"off\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"region\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"year\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"novel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"all\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"initial\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"majority\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"prolific\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Boon\",\"NN\"]],[[\"debut\",\"NN\"]],[[\"British\",\"JJ\"],[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"hint\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"finishing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"prime\",\"JJ\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"copper\",\"NN\"]],[[\"alcoholism\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"seventh\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"position\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"new\",\"JJ\"],[\"sidekick\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"remainder\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"wonderful\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"standard\",\"NN\"]],[[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"class\",\"NN\"]],[[\"full\",\"JJ\"],[\"mileage\",\"NN\"]],[[\"rural\",\"JJ\"],[\"setting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"nephew\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"quality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"big\",\"JJ\"],[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"someday\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"cinema\",\"NN\"]],[[\"feature\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"quality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"stuff\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"small\",\"JJ\"],[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mediocre\",\"NN\"]],[[\"stuff\",\"NN\"]],[[\"picture\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"debut\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"manner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"other\",\"JJ\"],[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"title\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"The Good Fight\",\"reviewText\":\"First off this horrible music, the heck is this \\\"School House Rock\\\" seriously!

Based on the real-life work of forensic anthropologist and novelist Kathy Reichs, it's fun, kicky, and only occasionally too gruesome to look at. Not quite like one of Ms. Reichs' novels, it is still a pleasure for a fan (me!) to watch. Boreanaz' past work on Buffy and Angel stands in good stead here as he delivers lines that stand up to a strong female role without diminishing it. Also like Buffy, humor lends grace to embarrassing social situations that highlight common human vulnerabilities. Surrounding the 2 major players are other characters who add to the thrust of a character driven show. The writers do good work giving each character unique attributes that have nothing to do with hair color or body measurements. The entire cast does a good job presenting real, quirky individuals who don't have to rely on looks to sell the worth of their character to the viewers. That alone is something new for any CSI show.

Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.\\n\\nThe casting is clever...very clever.

The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes.

Just what is its appeal?\\n\\nJames Spader as Red Reddington is the answer and the sole reason this show is so watchable. He's not only the captain of the ship, he's the crew and the ship as well.

The man is just a joy to watch and makes an improbable character--govt spy turned international criminal mastermind-- delightful and believable. Every actor on that show ought to thank Spader for allowing them the opportunity to make money on a show that would have been cancelled its first year--perhaps mid-season--if he were not on it. It's the darndest thing, the difference one actor can make. \\n\\nStill, I wish that the creators had chosen a different actress to play the part of Elizabeth Keen, the FBI profiler that Red Reddington is inexplicably fond of. Someone like Zoe Saldana would have been brilliant casting and added dimension to the mystery of the Keen-Reddington relationship. And perhaps better casting for that part would have inspired the writers to shape her role more credibly and sent the show into the stratosphere. While Megyn Kelly may be a solid actress, she does not yet have the chops to make something of the oddly inconsistent writing for her role. Too late to change this up now. \\n\\nI'm hardly the only fan who tunes in to enjoy Spader's performance, marveling at how the dreamy young actor with long blonde hair evolved into this very charming, balding older man who can act his *beep* off.

Both filmmakers are five-for-five thus far, with even Lowery's mainstream Disney remake, Pete's Dragon (2016), managing to impress in all sorts of ways I wasn't expecting. Apart from being enjoyable in its own right, it also showed us that Lowery is as comfortable making personal small-scale character dramas as he is big-budget special effects blockbusters. With The Old Man & the Gun, he stands somewhere between - it's not as intimate as St. Nick (2009), Ain't Them Bodies Saints, or A Ghost Story, but neither is it as mainstream as Pete's Dragon. Originally touted as Robert Redford's final performance, although he has walked that claim back somewhat, The Old Man & the Gun is a laid-back ballad-like elegy to both the character Redford is playing and to Redford himself. Filmed in the style of a 1970's indie, Old Man is so tied to Redford as a performer as to be virtually self-referential. In short, if you're not a fan of the actor, you will get absolutely nothing from this film.\\n\\nTelling the \\\"mostly true\\\" story of Forrest Tucker, Lowery's script is based primarily on David Grann's 2003 New Yorker article of the same name. By the time of the article, the 83-year-old Tucker, who had been robbing banks since his early 20s, had amassed at least 80 successful jobs and escaped from prison 18 times. Usually described by the tellers from whom he stole as \\\"gentlemanly\\\" and \\\"charming\\\", his M.O. never changed - he would walk into a bank and ask if he could open an account. When asked what kind, he would pull back his coat, showing his gun (which was often unloaded, and which he never fired), assure the teller that he didn't want any trouble, and quietly talk them through the process of emptying their till. He would then wish them the best, tell them they'd done well, and walk out. The story takes place in 1981, when Tucker was 61 (although in the film, he's 76), and had recently escaped from San Quentin. Meeting a widow named Jewel (Sissy Spacek), after pulling off a job, they strike up a tentative romance. Meanwhile, he is pursued by Det. John Hunt (Casey Affleck), who is starting to respect him more and more.\\n\\nThe first thing you'll notice about Old Man is its pace, which is measured, to say the least. Ostensibly, this is a heist film, but the crime narrative is very much secondary to tone and character beats. Lowery is relatively uninterested in excitement, suspense, plot twists, or any of the usual generic tropes. Instead, approaching the material casually, he focuses on a year of Tucker's life, with a tone as mellow as a film can be; rather than a shot of absinthe, it's a fine Irish malt drunk at a fireplace. Indeed, even within this structure, there's not a huge amount of character development, nor is there much of a dramatic arc. And that's not a criticism. Rather, the meditative, quasi-somnolent pace is very much one of the film's charms. Additionally, Lowery almost completely ignores what, for many, would be the most interesting part of Tucker's story - his 18 escapes. Instead, he puts them all together into one superb montage.\\n\\nHowever, for all that, Lowery's primary goal is to create an ode to an icon, and that icon is Robert Redford. Tucker's story is a vehicle which Lowery uses to celebrate Redford; the character is always there, but he exists behind the actor, rather than the other way around. The audience is never allowed to forget that this is Robert Redford on screen, to the point where the performance is self-referential. Indeed, during the escape montage, there's even a clip of Redford from another film, The Chase (1966). There's an obvious correlation between Tucker and Redford of which Lowery wants the audience to be very aware - they are both elderly, and still doing what they do best, reluctant to stop. We can never look past the fact that Tucker is played by Redford, and for the most part, Redford is playing Redford, with the film existing in large part only because it explicitly leans on his back catalogue and real-life legacy. Essentially, the whole thing is an extended metatextual allegory for Redford's own impending retirement, not to mention his reluctance to let go.\\n\\nAs one would expect from Lowery, aesthetically, the film is fascinating. Lowery is very unusual in the sense that, thus far, he has never used the same cinematographer twice. Here, he uses Joe Anderson, whose cinematography is extremely unique, with the celluloid having a gritty, grainy quality, almost as if it were an amateur project. This is because Lowery shot on Super 16, doing so because he wanted it to look like it had been made in the period in which it was set. This is in direct contrast to, say, how Michael Mann shot Public Enemies (2009), with the use of fast, seemingly anachronistic, digital photography creating a sense that what was happening on screen wasn't necessarily taking place in the past, but could easily have been taking place right now. Lowery, in contrast, tries to suture the viewer into the past milieu.\\n\\nAnother important aesthetic point is how much Lowery has obviously been influenced by Michael Mann, to whom there are several homages - a scene in a diner recalls a similarly shot scene between James Caan and Tuesday Weld in Thief (1981); the scene in the toilet where Hunt approaches Tucker is an obvious nod to Al Pacino confronting Robert De Niro in Heat (1995); and the scene of Tucker gaining inspiration whilst sitting in a cinema recalls a scene where Dillinger (Johnny Depp) does the same thing in Public Enemies.\\n\\nIn terms of problems, there are a few. For many, the film will depend far too much on Redford, specifically the self-referential allusions to his career and legacy. If you're not a fan of his, you will get zero from this, absolutely nothing. Similarly, if you aren't familiar with at least some of his previous work, and his status in Hollywood, the whole thing will probably seem inconsequential. Another problem I have concerns Affleck. I know he's a celebrated actor and so forth, but for me, he plays himself in every single movie. There is virtually nothing to distinguish Hunt from Robert Ford in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) or Les Chandler from Manchester by the Sea (2016), or either of his performances in previous Lowery films. Every performance he gives, he plays a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, shuffling around, speaking in a low-key hang-dog voice, reluctant to make eye contact, shifting on his feet.\\n\\nLowery also has a strange habit of introducing themes which seem to be setting something up, only to completely abandon them without any kind of engagement. This is most obvious in relation to Hunt's inter-racial marriage to Maureen (Tika Sumpter) and their two mixed-race children. This is a fictional element added by Lowery, so one assumes there was some thought behind it. But this is Texas in 1981; there wouldn't have been a huge amount of mixed marriages. Yet Lowery seems to portray it as if it's the most normal thing in the world. Indeed, for the wife and children, life is fairly idyllic, with not a hint of any kind of societal disapproval. Why would you introduce a mixed-race marriage into this milieu without commenting on it?\\n\\nThese issues aside, however, The Old Man & the Gun is a fine film. As much about Robert Redford as it is Forrest Tucker, although that won't appeal to everyone, there is much to praise. Made in a key so low, it's practically subterranean, Lowery hinges everything on Redford's presence, and, for the most part, it works well. There's little in here to get overly excited about, but neither is there much to criticise. Yes, the film is somewhat insubstantial, and there's virtually nothing here beyond the Redford\\/Tucker character, but it's still beautifully made, and, honestly, there's nothing wrong with spending 93 minutes hanging out with Redford, whether he's playing Forrest Tucker or Robert Redford. Whether or not this is actually his last performance remains to be seen, but if it is, it's as fine a send-off as any Hollywood icon could hope for.\",\"NP\":[[[\"tall\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"existential\",\"JJ\"],[\"masterpiece\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mainstream\",\"NN\"]],[[\"remake\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"right\",\"NN\"]],[[\"personal\",\"JJ\"],[\"small-scale\",\"JJ\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dramas\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intimate\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mainstream\",\"NN\"]],[[\"final\",\"JJ\"],[\"performance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"claim\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"laid-back\",\"JJ\"],[\"ballad-like\",\"JJ\"],[\"elegy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"indie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"performer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"fan\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"actor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nothing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"script\",\"NN\"]],[[\"article\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"name\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"article\",\"NN\"]],[[\"prison\",\"NN\"]],[[\"charming\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bank\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"account\",\"NN\"]],[[\"kind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"coat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gun\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"teller\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"trouble\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"process\",\"NN\"]],[[\"till\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"place\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"widow\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"job\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"tentative\",\"JJ\"],[\"romance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pace\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"heist\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"narrative\",\"NN\"]],[[\"much\",\"JJ\"],[\"secondary\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"excitement\",\"NN\"]],[[\"suspense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"material\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"year\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"tone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"shot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"absinthe\",\"NN\"]],[[\"malt\",\"NN\"]],[[\"drunk\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"fireplace\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"structure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"huge\",\"JJ\"],[\"amount\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"development\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"dramatic\",\"JJ\"],[\"arc\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"criticism\",\"NN\"]],[[\"quasi-somnolent\",\"JJ\"],[\"pace\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"interesting\",\"JJ\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"superb\",\"NN\"]],[[\"montage\",\"NN\"]],[[\"primary\",\"JJ\"],[\"goal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"ode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"icon\",\"NN\"]],[[\"icon\",\"NN\"]],[[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"vehicle\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"actor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"other\",\"JJ\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"performance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"escape\",\"NN\"]],[[\"montage\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"clip\",\"NN\"]],[[\"another\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"obvious\",\"JJ\"],[\"correlation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"fact\",\"NN\"]],[[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"large\",\"JJ\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"back\",\"NN\"]],[[\"catalogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"real-life\",\"JJ\"],[\"legacy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"whole\",\"JJ\"],[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"extended\",\"JJ\"],[\"metatextual\",\"JJ\"],[\"allegory\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"impending\",\"JJ\"],[\"retirement\",\"NN\"]],[[\"reluctance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"cinematographer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"twice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cinematography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"celluloid\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"gritty\",\"NN\"]],[[\"grainy\",\"JJ\"],[\"quality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"amateur\",\"NN\"]],[[\"project\",\"NN\"]],[[\"shot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"period\",\"NN\"]],[[\"direct\",\"JJ\"],[\"contrast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"use\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"digital\",\"JJ\"],[\"photography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"place\",\"NN\"]],[[\"place\",\"NN\"]],[[\"contrast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"viewer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"past\",\"JJ\"],[\"milieu\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Another\",\"DT\"],[\"important\",\"JJ\"],[\"aesthetic\",\"JJ\"],[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"diner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"shot\",\"JJ\"],[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"toilet\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"obvious\",\"JJ\"],[\"nod\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"inspiration\",\"NN\"]],[[\"whilst\",\"NN\"]],

Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.\\n\\nFor those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at. \\n\\nThen there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background \\\"noise\\\": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.\\n\\nThe writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know. \\n\\nAnd then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments. \\n\\nTo sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show.

The Wire's importance, beyond setting the standard for all modern television, is one of a historical document. 500 years from now, the show will surely be one of a handful that allows future generations to glean the state of American society during this time period -- it's problems, it's people, it's language, it's institutions, and the constant tension that exists when all of these are forced to coexist.\\n\\nThis is due to the fact that the Wire, through nuance and true-to- life portrayal of human interactions, constructs an extremely lucid and heart-breaking evaluation of almost every aspect of society. Most of you reading right now wake up every day as a cog in the massive, interwoven, and fundamentally autonomous institutions which together make up a capitalist society. However, given that we are all a minuscule part of this larger whole, it is nary impossible to take a step back and objectively evaluate just how much influence these institutions hold over the course of our lives. It's not unlike trying summarize a 1000-page novel while holding a single random page less than an inch from your face. Our perspectives are inherently limited in this regard, and so too is any vain attempt to connect the pieces and make sense of it all.\\n\\nThis point is one of the many reasons that the Wire warrants our time and careful consideration. From a bird's-eye perspective, each season builds on those prior until at the very end we have no choice but to reckon with vast tapestry of individual strands as a singular work. One that feels so true to life that it's near impossible for me to think of anything else, fiction or non-fiction, book or movie, painting or play, sculpture or architectural feat, which in their combined power holds the volume of educational lessons, thoughtfulness, humanism, pure ethos, or entertainment that the Wire does.\\n\\n\\\"All the pieces matter,\\\" a quote that flashes across the screen at the beginning of an episode in Season One, is prophetic in it's understanding that the totality of something can have a much greater impact than its individual parts. And that is why I find it upsetting when reading reviewers which call the show \\\"boring\\\" or \\\"slowly paced\\\" or \\\"overrated\\\" and then go on to admit that they gave up watching before the end of Season Two. \\n\\nI am not a cynic by nature and in general tend to dismiss the common criticism that our generation is one that needs constant gratification all of the time in order to stay engaged with something for the long haul. But in this case, I truly believe that the Wire is so much different than what most people are used to watching on the medium of television that some may get confused or frustrated when the show refuses to pander to the standard beats and thrill-inducing plot devices on an episode-by-episode basis which we have been trained to expect with TV shows. There are no neatly wrapped episode arcs, no spoon-feeding over obvious plot points via voice-overs or flashbacks, and no musical score to tell us how a particular scene or moment should make us feel.\\n\\nInstead, the show forces us to become witnesses to a series of events in much the same way we would witness something unfolding right in front of us. Especially during Season One, David Simon and his creative team give us a lot of footage that looks like it should be from a documentary. This is all intentional, of course. The 4:3 film, the non-HD look, the way the camera seems to lack the traditional god- like power to always know that a character is going to say something important so that it shows us that character a second or two before they say their line (indeed, if you watch closely you'll notice that there are times that the camera will only pan to a speaking character after they begin saying their lines, giving the viewer the distinct feeling of a real-life situation unfolding in real time) -- all of these things are by careful design. And all of these devices add to the show's power because the characters become more real when depicted in this way. This makes it all the more devastating every time one of these characters is chewed up and spit out by the merciless wheels of capitalistic institutions surrounding them. \\n\\nI chose to write a review which differs from many of the others here because simply rehashing why I love Omar so much, or which season is the best, or why I think it's better\\/worse than the Sopranos or Breaking Bad are all things which are touched upon over and over again. Instead I wanted to provide my own analysis about why the show succeeds and stands apart of from others to the point where comparison is futile. Some people, including myself, think that the show will provide you with such an empathy-rich experience that when you have finished you may potentially see the world a little bit differently, that you'll feel a little bit closer to all of the people you share this country with, no matter how different their persona or background is from your own. By this measure, your persistence and patience given to the show will be repaid 10-fold.\",\"NP\":[[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"shred\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hyperbole\",\"NN\"]],[[\"importance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"standard\",\"NN\"]],[[\"all\",\"DT\"],[\"modern\",\"JJ\"],[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"historical\",\"JJ\"],[\"document\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"handful\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"state\",\"NN\"]],[[\"American\",\"JJ\"],[\"society\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"period\",\"NN\"]],[[\"language\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"constant\",\"JJ\"],[\"tension\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"fact\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nuance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"true-to-\",\"JJ\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"portrayal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"heart-breaking\",\"JJ\"],[\"evaluation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"aspect\",\"NN\"]],[[\"society\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"day\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"cog\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"capitalist\",\"JJ\"],[\"society\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"minuscule\",\"JJ\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"step\",\"NN\"]],[[\"much\",\"JJ\"],[\"influence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"course\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"1000-page\",\"JJ\"],[\"novel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"single\",\"JJ\"],[\"random\",\"NN\"]],[[\"page\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"inch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"face\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"regard\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"vain\",\"JJ\"],[\"attempt\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"careful\",\"JJ\"],[\"consideration\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bird's-eye\",\"JJ\"],[\"perspective\",\"NN\"]],[[\"each\",\"DT\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"choice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"vast\",\"JJ\"],[\"tapestry\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"singular\",\"JJ\"],[\"work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fiction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"non-fiction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"book\",\"NN\"]],[[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"painting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"play\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sculpture\",\"NN\"]],[[\"architectural\",\"JJ\"],[\"feat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"combined\",\"JJ\"],[\"power\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"volume\",\"NN\"]],[[\"thoughtfulness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"humanism\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ethos\",\"NN\"]],[[\"entertainment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"matter\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"quote\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"beginning\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"totality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"impact\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"watching\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nature\",\"NN\"]],[[\"general\",\"JJ\"],[\"tend\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"common\",\"JJ\"],[\"criticism\",\"NN\"]],[[\"generation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"constant\",\"JJ\"],[\"gratification\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"order\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"long\",\"JJ\"],[\"haul\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"case\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"medium\",\"NN\"]],[[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"thrill-inducing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"episode-by-episode\",\"JJ\"],[\"basis\",\"NN\"]],[[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"arcs\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"spoon-feeding\",\"NN\"]],[[\"obvious\",\"JJ\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"musical\",\"JJ\"],[\"score\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"particular\",\"JJ\"],[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"moment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"front\",\"NN\"]],[[\"creative\",\"JJ\"],[\"team\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"footage\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"documentary\",\"NN\"]],[[\"course\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"non-HD\",\"JJ\"],[\"look\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"camera\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"traditional\",\"JJ\"],[\"god-\",\"NN\"]],[[\"power\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"line\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"camera\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"speaking\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"viewer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"distinct\",\"JJ\"],[\"feeling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"real-life\",\"JJ\"],[\"situation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"real\",\"JJ\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"careful\",\"JJ\"],[\"design\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"power\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"merciless\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"review\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"analysis\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"comparison\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"empathy-rich\",\"

The show seems to have spun out of the writers' control. Not only is Blum a horrible factor who makes the show so unpleasant that I do not want to continue watching, but the silly animations telling us what we already know seem like they are included so the writers can take a vacation from having to write a real script. The sidelining of the Maia character really weakens the show, and one axe throwing scene might have worked, but the repetition is grating. Since I am already suffering from All Trump All the Time torture, I really don't want more of him on a tv channel I pay for! Please stop! If there is a season 4, please cut out Blum, animations, and so much Trump. I hate him too, so I come to television to get away from him. The top actors are being wasted here.

'Homeland' is the new Showtime Drama that entertains you throughout and never lets you go, thus succeeding in slipping in some really unexpected twists in the plot. With writers who've previously written for '24', the show does look inspired when it comes to keeping the audience in the dark.\\n\\nThe show is blessed with a small but amazing cast whose performance is worth every penny. Claire Danes plays an intense CIA analyst who believes that recently recovered P.O.W. (Damian Lewis) is plotting to attack America. Her character is unstable and makes it hard for the audience to believe her which adds to the beauty of the script. Damian Lewis, on the other hand, plays the 'guy in uniform' with ease as he did splendidly in 'Band of Brothers'. The show hasn't revealed much about Damian's character and I have a feeling they wouldn't do that any time soon, since it keeps the suspense going.\\n\\nThe pilot was top-notch and certainly the best that premiered this fall.

She is serious, candid and forthright. Her ability to \\\"handle\\\" herself stems from confidence and experience, not tragedy or pathology as is so often the case in TV-land female characters.\\n\\nSpecial Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) could be a hardened, tough guy, stereotypical character. He is not. While we are reminded regularly of his past as a military sniper, the sensitivity he brings to his duties as an FBI agent redeem his past actions, as is his hope. Make no mistake, he is a fierce patriot and proud FBI man, yet his character's motives and motivation are clear and noble. They are never fanatically righteous or overbearingly macho.\\n\\nThese two characters are wonderfully balanced with each other: their approach to life, to their work, to the pursuit of this week's mystery. Their relationship rings true. Through agreements, disagreements and the sense of humor it takes to weather both, Deschanel and Boreanaz always deliver the wry portrayal these two staunchly serious, but genuinely human characters deserve. Each character's work is expertly accomplished and equally important to the solutions they unravel together. As audience, we enjoy their working together. Temperance Brennan and Seeley Booth are a great team - as are Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz.\\n\\nWith these two very real 21st Century individuals, and stories that skillfully incorporate forensic anthropology, both as it is used in the discipline of anthropology to understand the most ancient of artifacts, and as it is used in the most modern criminal labs, the foundation is strong for TV entertainment of the highest kind. But, it isn't only the charisma of the two main characters or their portrayers that keeps the show real, believable, compelling. Dr. Brennan's support team at the lab are a fine crew (Michaela Conlin as Angela Montenegro - forensic artist and friend to Dr. Brennan, Eric Millegan as Zack Addy - genius, geeky, naively lovable forensic anthropologist in-training, T.J. Thyne as Dr. Jack Hodgins - soil, bug and all-things-creepy expert, and Jonathan Adams as Dr. Daniel Goodman - administrator\\/anthropologist and the lab crew's boss).

Her FBI husband Nick Durand has remarried to Alice and Emily's son Flynn has long forgotten her. Nick receives a late night call from Harlow which leads to Emily's rescue from her watery tomb. Harlow is released from prison as trial evidences are proved incorrect. Emily's original target, crime boss Robert Semerov, is found waiting in the morgue and she is implicated. Boston police detective Tommy Gibbs investigates her case as she goes on the run. Her brother Jack and father Warren are her main supporters as even Nick starts to disbelieve her.\\n\\nThis has a nice dark mood and compelling mysterious premise. I like the first couple of episodes but the show bogs down into a convoluted reveal. If her past is the main reveal, then it needs to be presented right at the beginning. The way to do it are flashbacks to her childhood as the B-story. A younger Emily would allow a back and forth to the present day story. It would give better preparation for the ultimate reveal. The acting is relative good although I don't remember the villains. Without the preparation, the revelations don't hit as hard and the reveal lacks real shock. This is fine but it could have been better.\\n\\nEDIT: I did not expect a second season. Two starts with an attack on the federal government. Emily returns to work and tries to reconnect with her son. This season suffers from a similar situation as the first season. It starts one way and finishes another way. This one starts like it wants Emily to be in a police procedural. I really like her new relationship with her son. When her mother shows up, it would have been a great family drama. I don't really love it but I can see it working. Then it takes twists which loops back to the first season. Instead of the twists, it should be simply Emily alone investigating her case without the extra layer of investigation. This show often gets too muddled for its own good.

The way he raved about it I thought I'd give it a go just to shut him up. I really couldn't get in to it and, after the pilot episode, gave up and didn't watch it any more. Fast forward to 2019. Looking through Netflix I came across this series once again so thought I'd give it another go. Now, I don't know if I've changed in these past years or I just didn't give it long enough first time round but, Wow! Over the last three weeks I have binge watched the entire series, averaging four episodes a day (unfortunately I have to work as well). What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said by other reviewers who are more grammatically articulate than I am. It easy to see why Breaking Bad won as many awards as it did. The writing is superb, not to mention the acting from its two main stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walt and Jesse. By the end of the last episode I felt my heart was broken.

It stars Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, a tough-as-nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show. He has another side, a vicious side, that Criminal Intent's Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) lacks. I'm very pleased that he's been nominated for an Emmy. Mariska Hargitay won an Emmy for her performance as Olivia Benson, another fantastic detective. Benson has more edge than CI's Alex Eames (Kathrine Erbe), but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects. Her life is put in danger at least twice a season, yet she continues to be strong. Next is the sarcastic detective Jon Munch, played by the excellent comedian Richard Belzer. Munch may seem annoying at times, but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent, and he plays the \\\"good cop, bad cop\\\" role very well. The final detective is Finn Tutuola, played by former rapper Ice-T. Ice-T plays the character reasonably well, but I think we'd all like to see a meaner side of him. He was very good in the episodes entitled \\\"Rage,\\\" and \\\"Rooftop\\\". They are led by Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek, and Cragen is as good a captain as any, as Florek reprises his role he held on \\\"Law & Order\\\" for a few years. Adam Beach recently joined the show, bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost 'surfer dude' approach to detective work. The ADA now is Casey Novak, played by Diane Neal, who could be better, but she gets the job done. She's been better of late, and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show. Her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was great also. The team is also aided by an FBI psychiatrist, George Huang (BD Wong), who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person, witness or suspect. His best performance was in the episode called \\\"Coerced.\\\" The members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes (rape, rape-homicide) and child based crimes (school shootings, child abuse, child molestation). The show has had extraordinary guest stars, from evil (Johnny Messner, Reg Flowers, Asio Highsmith, Jeff Kober) to touching (Leland Orser, Jerry Lewis) to lost (Brittany Snow) to famous and legendary actors (Jerry Lewis, Dean Cain, Chris \\\"Ludacris\\\" Bridges, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Matthew Modine, Alfred Molina, Cynthia Nixon, John Ritter).

John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no needless character or background, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added. But that is not a problem.

Comparison to The Identity is present but please do not compare it to Tarantino style films jus cos it has a nonlinear approach. Fellas who r comparing the nonlinear film style to Tarantino's films ain't aware of Jean-Luc Godard, the pioneer of nonlinear filmmaking. Is it a coincidence that the surname of the director of this film too is Goddard. Drew Goddard is in full Jean-Luc Godard-esque mood. Attention is required as every person at the El Royale has a story n the background story of all the characters were properly interwined. Some of the scenes r way too slow n the editing needed some post production work. Jus few days back i saw Chronicles of the Ghostly tribe n i wrote in its review that the flashbacks were confusing n not at all gripping but in El Royale the flashbacks were intriguing n not at all confusing. The film is visually striking and offers a high level of ambience. It has lots of eerie mood, good suspense, a great sense of dread throughout. The background story of one of the character which is shown towards the end is a bit shocking n well placed.

Not to mention the fact that all the rumors mentioned different takes on characters, etc?\\n\\nI tried it anyway... and I'm glad I did!\\n\\nThere is an awful lot to like here. First of all, the characters are interesting: interesting enough to make you forget all about Batman! You root for Gordon, you're annoyed at Bullock, Fish gives you the creeps and Penguin... let's just say he's moved up in my favorite villains list (and he was near the bottom, let me tell you!).\\n\\nThe acting is great (again I must mention Penguin) and while some have said it's over the top... maybe it is, but it's never distracting and fits within the universe that we're presented with.\\n\\nAs I mentioned above, the series has its own take on the universe - you'll soon recognize certain characters, even though they're introduced in ways that are different than what you knew from the comics - and yet, even as a seasoned Batman fan, I was never bothered by the differences and enjoyed the fresh perspectives on familiar characters.\\n\\nAlso, don't worry about the writers shoe-horning in characters, just to get them on screen. Every character I've seen makes sense within the series.\\n\\nThe first season (which I'm basing this review on) has overarching plot lines, but occasionally has \\\"freak of the week\\\" episodes. I was never bored, though (as I regularly was when watching Flash or Arrow) and it's obvious the writing went towards longer plots when it was clear the show was doing well. It never steeps to \\\"cop show\\\" levels, which is an achievement.\\n\\nFinally, I must commend the \\\"atmosphere\\\" of the series. It all feels very \\\"Gotham\\\", including the shots of the city skyline, the sets, the extras... it all comes together feeling very Batman, without actually having Batman in the mix...\\n\\nDo I have any criticism? Not really, no.

From then on I couldn't forget it, I missed it. I started watching several shows later, but nothing came close to BB. I went on a search for such exciting crime dramas and then I saw few people on reddit talk about Narcos and Fargo (most of them) to experience something similar. At first, I googled them and decided to watch Narcos as Google knowledge graph mentions Fargo as a comedy series. So, yeah Narcos was enthralling, but didn't really feel 10\\/10 especially with too much Spanish. Then I decided to give a try on Fargo and boy oh boy! It's simply sensational.\\n\\nSeason 1: The first episode itself left me exuberant. This Martin Freeman guy, right from the day I saw him as Bilbao Baggins, everything he does impresses me and in Fargo there's nothing less. And the others were excellent too, especially Billy Bob Throtton, that man is really one hell of an actor. He is an assassin, every scene of him is jaw dropping with some chills. All in all, Season 1 of Fargo was really the one I was waiting for these whole 6 months and I didn't want to end this beautiful experience, so I immediately decided to watch Season 2.\\n\\nSeason 2: Everyone who watched season 1 will have some idea about how season 2 will go on. It opened off very well and the first episode here too ends dramatically. The next 2 episodes were slow-paced and I thought this might turn out like True Detective Season 2 as it couldn't really recreate the magic of the first season (just my opinion). So, right when I thought it's sinking, it just gets better and better from episode 4. There won't be a moment you could take your eyes off till the last minute of the season finale. I'm glad they renewed it for the next season and I really can't wait for that.\\n\\nThe music utilized over the two seasons is absolutely mind blowing, the way it relates to each and every scenario is just spectacular. Along with this awesome music, the outstanding piece of poetry depicts the ongoing lives of the people in Fargo. The direction part is really masterful and you can clearly see that in the second season\\\".

I would even go as far as to say TV history in the making. Negative critics of the show seem to have overlooked the fact that this is the first time ever that this side of British gangster-lore has been documented. Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham. \\n\\nThe attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard. As is the quality of acting, which is undeniably as good as you'll find in any prime-time British drama.\\n\\nEven though people on this particular forum have not had much positive feedback about the series, believe me, the connoisseurs of this genre have been very impressed thus far. Furthermore, the show seems to be building up to climatic ending rather than simply documenting a day in the life of a Peaky Blinder. The more observant viewers will see subtle 'tie-ins' between each situation and be able to follow the flow of events without obvious prediction. This is what the drama audience thrives on to stimulate analytical debate after each episode.\\n\\nIf it doesn't get rave reviews, I will be disappointed but not surprised, as Peaky Blinders has all the makings of an artistic and timeless cult series, possibly appealing more to purists and true fans of the cult\\/gangster genre.

The attention to detail,story and character is second to none. Deadwood is brought to life by the good, the bad and the very ugly- with some of the most wonderfully theatrically profane, but ultra-realistic dialogue of any western. True, you could question some of the dialogue for exactly how accurate it is to the time it is set- but it sounds absolutely convincing in the world they have managed to build. Lets face it- not too many Westerns even bothered all that much in the first place! The 3 series have impeccable standards of production, weaving some of the real historical events of the time into a fictional Old West testament. The degradation, ill manners, costumes, dirt, mud and profanities are all present and accounted for.\\n\\nAside from the \\\"real\\\" characters we know of from Deadwood (Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane and even the Sheriff Bullock), we have some of the most unsavoury villains of the time as well.\\n\\nThe various stories, historical events and personal issues of the characters interweave with no discernible template or pattern to formalise the show. The only thing that is certain in the old West is that where the desire for excess, fortune and greed are combined, human nature will see to the rest.\\n\\nStand out performances are plentiful in this series- but Ian McShane is incredible, a true tour-de-force, a foul-mouthed, back-stabbing bad ass villain- who manages to humanise a repellent character in Al Swearengen.\\n\\nAs the series wore on, the writers broadened his character and nature a little more so it was unavoidable but to side with him- even agree with his nastiest ideas.\\n\\nThis was not a compromise or sell-out of the principally dark natured and notoriously ill-tempered brothel owner! \\\"Sparks\\\" of humanity seem to have warmed his character, particularly from his confrontations with the flint-like moral code & core of Sheriff Bullock (Timothy Olyphant). However, even Bullocks is prone to questionable actions, as he wrestles with his own conscience to resolve things in a \\\"civil\\\" way, or resort to a pistol-whipping to get the job done.\\n\\nIf you have never seen this- look out for repeats or go buy the box sets and enjoy the best Western experience ever made.

One major critic of the show will be how the writers will often attempt to put in too many love sequences in a super hero show, another will be how the story doesn't follow up as well with the Green Arrow comics. If the show sticks to its action first and love story later, it will stay more consistent to what fans would love to see, and this will keep the show alive for a longer number of seasons. The best part of this show is that it provides its viewers with crossover episodes, and team ups with other super hero shows such as the Flash. These crossover episodes provides more action and delivers a comic book genre type of team up for fans or even non comic book fans to enjoy.

It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!\\n\\nOld school action with no shaky cam. Definitely the best stunt-man-turned-director-debut I've ever seen. The story is set about John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired assassin, who gets dragged back into his field when the Russian Mob put a hit out on him, but instead of killing John, they steal his classic Mustang and kill his newly acquired puppy. This sets John out to exact revenge on the whole mob in a no nonsense kind of way...multiple shots to the chest and one to the head for good measure type of justice. I've never seen a film where the gun play is this to the point and precise as this. I don't know what the body count is, but it's gotta be up there...way up there. Oh...and another thing...they actually reload the guns. Don't see that that often in films. It's got an all star cast of cameo\\/small roll characters, from Ian McShane, William Dafoe, and John Leguizamo, and I swear one of the bad guy henchman is that \\\"Mayhem\\\" Insurance guy. One of the Best Movie, that Keanu Reeves ever made. From start to finish. Non stop action, all scenes look very realistic. ( The best action movie of the year. ) \\n\\nI Love this movie so much I think the people behind this movie made a great astonish action movie. There are other things in the movie that I love so much. I even think John Wick is so much better than 47 Ronin (2013) that Keanu Reeves made. The most that I love in this movie is Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins I think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin I have ever seen. Ms. Perkins made me realized and inspired me that there are a lot of women who choose occupation as a female assassin hired by the mob. There were a lot of female actresses who played an assassin but I have never see any women portrayed like that. Adrianne Palicki is a bad ass! She even played Lady Jaye in the G.I. Joe Team's covert operations a specialist in the movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) one of my favorite movies. The fight sequence between John Wick and Viggo Tarasov is real and very realistic I did not see any CGI in it. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The The stunts are completely insane in scale. There is a lot of gun play and powder even the guys reload guns. There are even Daniel Bernhardt from Bloodsport II and The Matrix Reloaded in it. And he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with Keanu Reeves were well done by him. This is the first time In the movie I see Willem Dafoe been the good guy. I haven't seen him in decades playing the good guy since Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam war movie! \\n\\nThe last thing about the movie I want to say that John Wick was a dog lover and I love dogs. I love how he avenge the puppy's death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was wounded.

Having been in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, and All the President's Men, he has a track record of several classical movies, but has managed to maintain a modern career with All is Lost, the Pete's Dragon remake, and even Captain America: The Winter Soldier. How does he manage to keep a lasting legacy when Hollywood tends to dispose of older actors? Robert Redford's personality represents a certain charisma that's so charming that you feel like you could follow him no matter where. His relaxed, more reserved nature allows him to be seen as a classical and modern face that can be liked by most people.\\n\\nI think a lot it also comes from how little he reveals about his private life. You get the sense that he has nothing to hide, but nothing to present either. He just seems like one of the few honest faces around Hollywood. Because of this, he's always played good guys, rarely stepping into the role of an antagonist. What's good about his role in The Old Man & the Gun is that he plays a criminal whose constantly on that grey line of good and bad.\\n\\nIn 1981, seventy-year-old Forrest Tucker (played by Robert Redford) is a compulsive robber who has a unique way of cleaning out the bank. Unlike the gun wielding, screaming crooks who threaten to kill everyone, Tucker is more likely to walk in with his team, ask for the manager, and simply tell him or her that the bank is being robbed and will use a gun if necessary. The managers comply as he's never rude, and even charming about it. This puts these people in such a relaxed, clearly thrown off position, that he's usually able to walk out without concern.\\n\\nAccording to detective John Hunt (played by Casey Affleck), the man assigned to track Tucker, the old man has been in and out of prison several times, always escaping. Hunt spends his time trying to track Tucker throughout Texas, while maintaining his family life. At the same time, Tucker feels confident enough to not only sit with horse rancher Jewel (played by Sissy Spacek), but to also admit he's a bank robber. She too is charmed by his personality and doesn't object. Tucker continues to rob banks, trying to stay ahead of the police and detective Hunt.\\n\\nAs a final outing, The Old Man & the Gun is a good one to go out on. A good but not great movie. It does take advantage of the kind of person Robert Redford is; a charmer. Though I was hesitant, it turns out with the way Redford portrays Tucker, I could see this person as this plausibly good a robbing places. I am glad they also show that he's not a complete success, as they do show that a lot of what he does is more compulsory then anything. This is the kind of role that needs a Robert Redford. This is the kind of role that I could see Cary Grant or Kirk Douglass could have played if the movie had been made back in the eighties.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, director David Lowery (Pete's Dragon, A Ghost Story) tries hard to emulate the style and look of an eighties movies, with a softer picture and even a grainer look. Though I don't know if this makes the movie bad, I'm not sure why this style was done for this kind of movie. I think it was to have a similar feel for the Redford classic, The Sting.\\n\\nThe reason I bring this up is that it results is more of a \\\"style over substance\\\" movie that I think detracts from the movie's more character driven intention. It's still interesting to hear these characters converse, but something about the way it was made kept me unengaged. I think if the project had been made more traditionally, this may have sold it better, showing that Redford isn't a product of the time. The good news is that much of the style is made up with the material and the actors delivering it.\\n\\nI'll give this seven old hearing pieces out of ten. Though I'm not sure what could have elevated it as one of the greats of his career, Robert Redford does prove that his charisma can carry a movie fine. It'll defiantly please his fans and those wanting a movie that does feel like an eighties movie; not the cult ones, but the slower, more atmospheric ones like a Robert Altman picture. Give it a watch and see if this was a good one to end on.\",\"NP\":[[[\"final\",\"JJ\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"actor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"track\",\"NN\"]],[[\"record\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"modern\",\"JJ\"],[\"career\",\"NN\"]],[[\"remake\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lasting\",\"JJ\"],[\"legacy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"personality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"certain\",\"JJ\"],[\"charisma\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"matter\",\"NN\"]],[[\"relaxed\",\"NN\"]],[[\"reserved\",\"JJ\"],[\"nature\",\"NN\"]],[[\"modern\",\"JJ\"],[\"face\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"private\",\"JJ\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nothing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nothing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"few\",\"JJ\"],[\"honest\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"antagonist\",\"NN\"]],[[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"grey\",\"JJ\"],[\"line\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"compulsive\",\"JJ\"],[\"robber\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"unique\",\"JJ\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"bank\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"gun\",\"NN\"]],[[\"wielding\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"team\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ask\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"manager\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"bank\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"gun\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"relaxed\",\"NN\"]],[[\"position\",\"NN\"]],[[\"concern\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"old\",\"JJ\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"prison\",\"NN\"]],[[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"family\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"horse\",\"NN\"]],[[\"rancher\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bank\",\"NN\"]],[[\"robber\",\"NN\"]],[[\"personality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Tucker\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"police\",\"NN\"]],[[\"detective\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"final\",\"JJ\"],[\"outing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"one\",\"NN\"]],[[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"advantage\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"kind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"person\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"charmer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"person\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"robbing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"complete\",\"JJ\"],[\"success\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"kind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"kind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Speaking\",\"NN\"]],[[\"director\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"look\",\"NN\"]],[[\"picture\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"grainer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"look\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"kind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"similar\",\"JJ\"],[\"feel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"classic\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"reason\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"up\",\"NN\"]],[[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"substance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intention\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"project\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"product\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"news\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"material\",\"NN\"]],[[\"old\",\"JJ\"],[\"hearing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ten\",\"NN\"]],[[\"career\",\"NN\"]],[[\"charisma\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fine\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"cult\",\"NN\"]],[[\"picture\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"watch\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"NCIS\",\"reviewText\":\"At first when my husband would watch this show I wasn't really paying much attention and I would see this goth girl in the lab and think  \\\"what on earth is THAT?!?!?!\\\" Then, one night I sat and watched along with him and now I am totally hooked.

Sure, in it's nature, that's what the show is. But unlike other TV spin-off's that are just 'extra' episodes that degrade the original show, Better Call Saul has significant promise as a standalone series that could come to rival it's predecessor.\\n\\nFrom the very beginning, the show returned me to the universe of Breaking Bad. Not in the obvious ways of reviving characters and settings, but through the subtle cinematography and script writing of Vince Gilligan. The camera focus changes and the interesting angled shots are quite unique to Gilligan's shows. This artistic and cinematic experience that begun with Breaking Bad is now continuing with Better Call Saul, once again proving that television can be as good, if not better than films.\\n\\nThe acting in the series is incredible. I don't think anyone will be able to top Cranston's portrayal of Walter White, but Odenkirk forms far more depth in the character of Saul Goodman than we ever see in Breaking Bad. Moving away from just comic relief, Saul is now a darker version of his false identity, and Odenkirk finds the balance between these two personas very well. Hopefully he will continue this standard to give Jimmy McGill a Walter White-like descent into the criminal world. \\n\\nThe humor in Better Call Saul is really well done. The show isn't a comedy, but the occasional funny moments are quite akin to what was done in Breaking Bad. The dark, witty wordplay made me laugh quite a few times at Saul's... sorry, Jimmy's lines, with the subtlety of the script writing shining through. \\n\\nThe music by Dave Porter once again really adds to the engrossing cinematic experience of the show. The musical choices are reminiscent of Breaking Bad, but are moulded in a very different way to form a lighter tone in some of the more comical moments. The weird and wonderful musical montage songs are back (starting in the first scene), which brings us back to Walt and Jesse's cooking (Crystal Blue Persuasion, anyone?).\\n\\nGilligan and Gould start the story with quite a lot of missing context surrounding Jimmy's brother Chuck and his law firm. Although this may be confusing in the beginning, I later realized this was intentional. Instead of just spitting out the back story in unnatural ways, the writers make you think about the situations, and gradually piece together what happened before the events of the show.

Let me introduce you The Wire, the best TV show put on small screens. The show that will, after you've finished it, live you empty inside, because you'll never find another TV show that can rival it. With it's five seasons, The Wire raised the bar of quality for TV shows, the bar that no TV show to date has managed to reach. \\n\\nThe Wire's story is set in the city of Baltimore, and it's about the slow fall of Baltimore city, about the pointlessness of the war on drugs, the bureaucracy and corruption that infest both the police force and drug-dealing gangs, class war against the labor unions, and the city's dysfunctional public schools system. And it's all shown through the perspective of law enforcement and drug dealers. As the story goes, you'll encounter well thought out plot twists, and you'll see a lot of characters die, because, as David Simon said: \\\"We are not selling hope, or audience gratification, or cheap victories with this show. The Wire is making an argument about what institutions\\u2014bureaucracies, criminal enterprises, the cultures of addiction, raw capitalism even\\u2014do to individuals. It is not designed purely as an entertainment. It is, I'm afraid, a somewhat angry show.\\\", and that makes the show so great, because deaths have meanings and consequences, and aren't just there for the shock factor like in Game Of Thrones. It also helps that Simons knows what he's talking about since he was writing a lot for the Baltimore Sun, and he saw a lot of things on the streets that are portrayed in the show. \\n\\nOne of the things I really love about The Wire is that characters aren't all good or all bad. They're gray, when it comes to their morality. Simon challenges the viewer to like characters, a lot of characters will do some bad things, and you'll probably agree on a lot of them given the situation they're in. The writing is just great, The Wire has a web of a lot of characters and the show spins them well. From McNulty to Stringer Bell, there are a lot of complex and great written characters, but there are also some weaker ones, but that's also to be expected, because the show has more than the hundred characters and you can't expect that they'll all be on the same level of writing. There is no plot armor in this show, a lot of characters will die, and, as I've already said, their deaths have consequences, and aren't just meant to be shock factor. \\n\\nActing team consists of familiar HBO actors, and of real cops and criminals, and they all did a pretty damn good job. Some are weaker, and that is most notable during season 1 and 5, but weak actor aren't that usual in the show, so don't worry. I'd say the best actor is easily Dominic West as McNulty, who stole the show for me, but since I'm biased towards McNulty, don't take my word for granted. \\n\\nThe only problem I had with the The Wire was one of fifth season's arcs, the one with the newspapers. It felt out of place for me, and it wasn't that interesting. It didn't introduce interesting characters nor was it on par with The Wire's better arcs.\\n\\nIn the end, The Wire did what little to no TV show could hope to do, it succeed with it's extremely ambitious, and I'd say impossible mission to tell a story of Baltimore's crumble. The social commentary, the writing on the characters, the well thought out plot twists, great directory, and David Simon's expertise on the case made The Wire the best television show ever seen on small screens. Enjoy the ride while it lasts, because once it ends, you'll be left with an empty whole within yourself, because they'll never be a TV show that could rival The Wire.

It's an adaptation that puts intelligent twists to the original story and yet established itself as sufficiently well crafted to stand on its own as one of, if not, the best television series around at the moment. The acting is superb with Jonny Lee Miller, Lucy Liu, Aiden Quinn and Jon Michael Hill carrying the weekly load, with appearances from the likes of Rhys Ivans, Natalie Dormer, Sean Pertwee and even Vinnie Jones to bring some variety. The stories are dramatic, mostly unpredictable with touches of humour and draw on aspects of the modern day as to make them very interesting. I love how they explore the relationships between the characters on both sides of the law and how they deal with their demons both past and present. I find that many episodes explore the fringes of the modern world through topics covering science, computing, art, finance, etc. and this adds to the richness of the plots which, along with the writing, are the strongest aspects of the series.

I'm just afraid that if this is standard stuff, I can't imagine much else being this good, let alone better. Nevertheless, I'm afraid that the inexplicable translation from Zone Blanche to \\\"Black Spot\\\" (in the US) could result in missed viewers who came up with wrong programs in their searches. This was my favorite discovery of 2017.\\n\\nThe assortment of characters are blended into a very believable ensemble as not one single one of them plays a disposable role. Some, who seem passive throughout, turn out to be critical antagonists eventually--it's a neat trick. The combination of the fantastic fog and woods environment coupled with an overt, but not overplayed, paranormal presence gives the viewer no shortage of suspense and chills. Watch it in a dark room without distractions.\\n\\nThis is what early Twin Peaks was. Undoubtedly, Lynch takes no credit as inspiration for and presumably has no connection with this production but, being a number one Lynch fan for 35 years now, I think this show's creators have outdone themselves and out-Lynched David, himself. This time. 9 stars.\\n\\nEDIT: Having added S2 I note the following changes. Interpersonal relationships between main characters intensify playing out mostly good. The oddball Siriani tends to gradually grow into his inevitable acceptance of life in Villefranche while Sheriff Weiss and Nonours experience turmoil and threats to their curious buddy-cop relationship. More notable is the much heavier handed treatment of the supernatural component in this season compared to S1. In S1 the ghosts were delicately treated here and there in the landscape, never overdone, but, in S2, producers have ramped the monster arc and Weiss' accompanying obsession onto center stage, which has taken time away from the single episode plots involving the very strange and entertaining curious Villefranche local folk. There is also a short mythical historic arc about first century Roman occupation of the locale intended to tie the paranormal business into current day Villefranche. This doesn't provide much. In all, I feel producers aimed to compose all the various threads to support the main arc of Weiss chasing her monster. This changed the show from an anthology with underlying connecting threads to a single long movie split into episodes. I liked season 1 better.

And its so surprising and refreshing to see that movies like this still exist. Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.\\n\\nAs with the previous 2 installments, John Wick 3 is where Keanu Reeves is at home. This role was just made for him, and watching him stand toe to toe with powerhouses like Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne and Anjelica Huston, not only shows how good he is as an action star, but as an actor in general. He hasn't been given a role this good since the Matrix, but those movies never showed how good he was just at acting. He sells this movie.\\n\\nThe supporting cast is all amazing, and I loved how they left their character's hanging, giving us hope of seeing them in future installments. I also loved how more in-depth the movie spent on world-building. The way it brings in different cultures into this assassin guild is done very well.\\n\\nJohn Wick 3 is an amazing action movie that never loses its steam throughout, and its 2 hour run times flies past, because of non-stop action that is directed and choreographed to perfection.

Indeed, the film does not really deal with the police investigation and modestly eludes the macabre scenes of crimes, but, on the contrary, it highlights the duality of the monster: an odd mix of a successful womanizer and an accomplished serial killer, of Casanova and Jack the ripper, or an unexpected materialization of Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, the fictional super-villain appearing in comic books published by DC, a criminal obsessed with duality and the conflict between good and evil.\\n\\nThus, although Ted Bundy appears or seems 'lovable' in some of the first scenes, the movie depicts us, during the second half, a pathetic seducer of any individual within his tiny environment (the journalists, the jurors, the judge, the audience, ...), able to arrogantly smile like a politician during an election campaign, and devoid of any respect for the victims. This guy will literally sent chills up your spine. The film sadly ends with an exhaustive list of known victims, and as many bruised families.\\n\\nGreat cast, especially Zac Efron unjustly cataloged with movies for decerebrated teenage girls, and excellently supported by Lily Collins, Kaya Scodelario, Angela Sarafyan.

Then the writers\\/produces irresponsibly ignore what these two characters brought to the show and it just seems writing\\/direction is forcefully introduced to steer the focus back to Carrie\\/Saul.

Emily Deschanel is fine, but rather young and headstrong compared to the book Tempe. Even in the one episode, we have seen her rushing into things quite recklessly. I guess they wanted to make her a little more dynamic for TV.\\n\\nThe chemistry between Brennan and Booth (Boreanaz) was pretty good from the start, although they need to handle it properly. Maybe the Mulder and Scully reference is a hint of how they might handle things. However, the crime was a little flimsy. This first episode seemed to focus far more on establishing character and tone than on plot. Probably something that will change with future episodes.\\n\\nOn the whole, Riechs fans can have fun being snooty and complaining about Tempe's drinking and the lack of her cat, but I thought the show had definite possibilities.

However, season 2 of this show takes a step in the wrong direction and is notably worse.\\n\\nOverall, the show is as dark and gritty as Daredevil is, mixed with a bit of dark humor as well. Jessica Jones is a good, noir style superhero show, that kind of fills a niche that wasn't previously filled before. One could argue that the first season actually has horror and thriller elements mixed in with it. This makes the show even better. The villain for season 1, Kilgrave, was absolutely incredible and is the highlight of the show. Played to perfection by David Tennant, you're glued to the screen whenever he's on. Krysten Ritter is also perfect as the sarcastic Jessica Jones. The casting made great choices there, although Marvel always does tend to make good casting decisions anyway. My least favorite part of season 1 being the character of Malcolm.

Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.\",\"NP\":[[[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"glance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"terrible\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"paper\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"slickness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"performance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"titular\",\"JJ\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sheer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brilliance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"year\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"absolute\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"past\",\"JJ\"],[\"decade\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"brutal\",\"JJ\"],[\"home\",\"NN\"]],[[\"invasion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"beloved\",\"JJ\"],[\"dog\",\"NN\"]],[[\"past\",\"NN\"]],[[\"revenge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"paper\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"direct-to-DVD\",\"JJ\"],[\"slopfest\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"lead\",\"NN\"]],[[\"welcomed\",\"JJ\"],[\"return\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"genre\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"overall\",\"JJ\"],[\"romp\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dialog\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mixed\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"swagger\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cool\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"such\",\"JJ\"],[\"confidence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"extreme\",\"JJ\"],[\"force\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"minute\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hell\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bad\",\"JJ\"],[\"guy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"other\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Every\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ruthless\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ruthless\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cool\",\"JJ\"],[\"dynamic\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"idea\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"revelation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"morality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brute\",\"JJ\"],[\"force\",\"NN\"]],[[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"blood\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pumping\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"showdown\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"nightclub\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sequence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"theater\",\"NN\"]],[[\"seat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sheer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intensity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"violent\",\"JJ\"],[\"fun\",\"NN\"]],[[\"surprising\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"guard\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Bad Times at the El Royale\",\"reviewText\":\"Bad Times at the El Royale is an incredibly captivating mystery \\/ thriller, and completely subverts expectations within the first 10 minutes. With an all-star cast, the acting is solid from start to finish, and Lewis Pullman (Miles, the hotel manager) steals the spotlight even with Chris Hemsworth in the mix. The structure of the film feels fresh and simulating, with non-linear storytelling and scenes from multiple perspectives, though at times, the pacing does tend to drag at certain parts. The more energetic scenes are accompanied by an incredible soundtrack, with classics from the 60's; that create a warm and versed vibe. The topics of ultimatums and self reflection are presented, and exceptionally highlight by the cinematography. Several scenes have the character looking through a one-way mirror, presenting a shot with what the character sees and, in the reflection, his\\/her reaction. There are also parts with vivid color and or contrast paired with beautiful composition that forms a stylistic vintage look. One of the film's problems is leaving open plot threads to hang, one character is believed to be promising and crucial in the beginning of the film but slowly dwindles away all, and connection and potential is lost.

Alongside ever charming Redford, having the likes of Danny Glover, Tom Waits, Casey Affleck and Sissy Spacek in the same film and that it was directed by David Lowery (best known to me for 'A Ghost Story' and 'Pete's Dragon', found myself liking both in their own way for different reasons, although the former is very polarising) also promises a lot.\\n\\nWhile not without its issues, 'The Old Man and the Gun' has a huge amount to recommend and its best assets are pretty wonderful. It very nearly became one of my favourite films of the year, and although it doesn't quite reach that it still is one of 2018's better films from personal opinion and every bit as deserving of the praise it's garnered. That is saying a fair bit as it has been a hit and miss year. And if it really is Redford's last film, he definitely goes out on a high and the film does him justice. Can see that 'The Old Man and the Gun' has not worked for all and that is understandable, it is not hard to see why it hasn't connected with some and any criticisms regarding some of the storytelling and pace are in my opinion valid.\\n\\nDid think that there are draggy stretches and parts where the storytelling borders on the repetitive side. The ending is rather anti-climactic.\\n\\nAlso felt that Casey Affleck's role was underwritten, it actually felt like it was intended to be a lead role but truncated, and Affleck is a little too laconic in it at times, though there are enough instances to show that it is actually still plays to his strengths as an actor.\\n\\nHowever, 'The Old Man and the Gun' is very rewarding elsewhere. Redford piles on the likeability and charm with effortless ease, really terrific work in a performance that dominates in a good way the film, and some of his best in years. The pathos that Sissy Spacek brings to her role is truly moving and while Danny Glover and Tom Waits don't have large roles, somewhat unshowy, they do make strong impressions because their screen presences are pitched perfectly. The character wriitng helps make the characters mostly compelling and they feel like real people, that for Redford's character has remarkable depth and there is a constant sense that Lowery and everybody else had immense respect for Redford without being self-indulgent. Lowery similarly directs impeccably, doing wonders with a story that fits so well with his style. Much of 'The Old Man and the Gun' has a relaxed style but still has momentum to stop it from being aimless.\\n\\nVisually, 'The Old Man and the Gun' is cleverly shot, with use of zooming and whip-pans, old-school style, that is stylish and affectionate rather than cheap. The scenery and production design are handsome and evocative without being too clean. The music is never too intrusive or too low-key, the jazzy nature nicely understated in parts in a very soothing sense while packing a punch in others. The script doesn't ramble or feel padded and has enough tautness and emotion. 'The Old Man and the Gun' boasts some thrilling action pieces enhanced by the photography, the robberies having the right amount of tension and brio, and the nods to past films, basically looking back on Redford's career and filmography, are affectionate rather than gimmicky. But it works even better in the calmer more introspective character moments. These moments are very charming and also very poignant.\\n\\nOverall, a very good film with many excellent elements. 8\\/10 Bethany Cox\",\"NP\":[[[\"final\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"main\",\"JJ\"],[\"interest\",\"NN\"]],[[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"positive\",\"JJ\"],[\"word\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mouth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"year\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"huge\",\"JJ\"],[\"amount\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"year\",\"NN\"]],[[\"personal\",\"JJ\"],[\"opinion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"deserving\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"praise\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"fair\",\"JJ\"],[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"hit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"miss\",\"JJ\"],[\"year\",\"NN\"]],[[\"last\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"justice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"storytelling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pace\",\"NN\"]],[[\"opinion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"valid\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"repetitive\",\"JJ\"],[\"side\",\"NN\"]],[[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lead\",\"JJ\"],[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"actor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"likeability\",\"NN\"]],[[\"charm\",\"NN\"]],[[\"effortless\",\"JJ\"],[\"ease\",\"NN\"]],[[\"terrific\",\"JJ\"],[\"work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"performance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"pathos\",\"NN\"]],[[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"wriitng\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"remarkable\",\"JJ\"],[\"depth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"constant\",\"JJ\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everybody\",\"NN\"]],[[\"immense\",\"JJ\"],[\"respect\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"relaxed\",\"JJ\"],[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"momentum\",\"NN\"]],[[\"aimless\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cleverly\",\"JJ\"],[\"shot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"use\",\"NN\"]],[[\"old-school\",\"JJ\"],[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"scenery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"production\",\"NN\"]],[[\"design\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"music\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"jazzy\",\"JJ\"],[\"nature\",\"NN\"]],[[\"soothing\",\"JJ\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"punch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"script\",\"NN\"]],[[\"enough\",\"JJ\"],[\"tautness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"emotion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"photography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"right\",\"JJ\"],[\"amount\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tension\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brio\",\"NN\"]],[[\"career\",\"NN\"]],[[\"filmography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"calmer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"introspective\",\"JJ\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"NCIS\",\"reviewText\":\"When the show first started out it was a little shaky, but since then has grown into its own.

On top of that, I was told that this Sherlock lived in London in 2010 and was fond of texting on his Blackberry and hosted a website? Color me confused! But I gave it a looksie \\u2013after all how bad could it be- Holmes is Holmes. On screen appears a lanky young fellow in a trench coat, getting high on nicotine patches who I am supposed to believe is Sherlock Holmes? This was, as far from my favorite pipe smoking, deer hunting cap wearing image of Holmes, as it could be. I rolled my eyes-this is going to be cheesy. But then in one swift sequence \\\" the lanky young Holmes\\\" in his first meeting with John Watson describes him, his profession , his relationship with his brother and his brother's marital status-all by one look at his cell phone (that's right his cell phone). BANG! I was hooked. This is Sherlock Holmes through and through.\\n\\nAnd that in essence is why Sherlock is so, so good. Holmes is not about the Victorian costumes and the environment in which the mysteries unfold. It's about the characters and the events that make the stories the defining mystery novels of so many generations. And Steven Moffat & Mark Gatiss' take on Conan Doyle's master detective captures the essence of Sherlock Holmes magnificently. The stories are essentially the same (the first episode-A Study in Pink is a take on A Study in Scarlet-the first Holmes novel) but given a contemporary twist. This contemporary take (which I thought was going to be cheesy initially) is what shows the duo's exemplary creativity. The modern outlook does not take away anything from the essence of Sherlock Holmes- it adds to it. The three 90 minute episodes breeze past you at a breath taking speed- challenging your intelligence and making you yearn for more. The episodes have distinctly dark and brutal settings but are also filled with moments of wry humor that make the experience completely satisfying. The concept of using images and visual pointers in the scenes were Holmes makes his superb deductions is excellent and helps the viewer see and think with the ace detective.\\n\\nAs for the cast, Benedict Cumberbatch is not the kind of guy who would strike you as Sherlock Holmes when you meet him in a street, but man, does he own the show! Oozing charisma, Cumberbatch plays the Holmes character to a tee-arrogant, self centered, brilliant genius. There is an air of superiority about Holmes that makes him pity the vacant minds that don't see and understand the things which seem so obvious to him and Cumberbatch brings that out beautifully. Martin Freeman as John Watson on the other hand plays a perfect foil to Cumberbatch's eccentric genius-the everyday man. Looking for meaning and purpose after returning from the War in Iraq, Watson gets swept into Holmes' mad cap world of brilliance and chaos. Freeman's earnest and subtle performance complements Cumberbatch's Holmes beautifully.\\n\\nSherlock though, is not about acting performances. It's about bringing the experience of the world of Sherlock Holmes to the world we live in. Moffat and Gattis recreate the world of the Victorian detective in a completely new setting and do it superbly.

The writing is of course sublime as it relies heavily on real events. The characters are complete and some of them you will remember decades from now.

Music, rarely used, sets the mood and gives a hint of how to interpret the theme.\\n\\nWatch it, then watch it again, and then again.

Hall. His own co-stars admit to being almost \\\"scared\\\" by how well Hall absorbs his character. Personally, I think that without Hall's mastery of Dexter there would be nothing to watch. Don't get me wrong, the plot of this show is extremely intriguing (and original, to be redundant), but the excitement lies purely in the way Dexter\\/Hall responds to A) his girlfriend, B) blood, and C) other serial killers.\\n\\nI think that it is very reasonable to chuckle at Dexter's attempts to \\\"fit in\\\" social situations and I believe the writers of this show planned on it.

I recently decided to give it a chance and was pleasantly surprised to say the least. First off, don't make the same mistake I did and dismiss it for some of the rather odd sounding changes, it's intended to be a different spin on the classic and does so very well.\\n\\nJonny Lee Miller plays a great Sherlock. He's more human and flawed, where the original Sherlock was almost cartoonishly strong at times, but he still has the same confident eccentric brilliance that makes Sherlock Holmes so interesting. He's a recovering addict aided by Sober Companion Watson, a modern politically correct spin on classic Holmes drug use that feels tacked on and out of place at times, but helps drive the character development of both Holmes and Watson.\\n\\nThe new Watson angle was a big factor in what made me pass on the show at first. In addition to the Sober Companion job, it sounded very generic Hollywoody to find an excuse to shoehorn in a pretty female co-star, but Lucy Liu is very good in her role. She doesn't play a shallow sexy distraction from the story, rather just a different sex portraying the same inquisitive, intelligent, adventurous companion that Watson should be. And (as far as I am in the series - fingers crossed) there's no pointless romantic subplots between her and Sherlock, just a straight played female Watson. Hats off to Lucy Liu for making a tough character change that I was prepared to dislike so likable and real.\\n\\nThe best part of the show however is the writing. Writing good mysteries is a fine line to walk. You can either give too little information and blindside the viewer, leaving them feeling shut out and just along for the ride, or too much information delivered too overtly and ruin the fun of following step in step with the details. The truth has to be there somewhere for you to see but not too soon. Elementary manages to walk that line very well.

We both hate it, but she is committed to watching all of it, to give an honest critique back to her friend. And thus, so am I.\\n\\n8 episodes in, and here is my take.\\n\\nIf you're 16, and are just beginning to watch and enjoy high school melodramas \\/ teen movies and such, this is for you!\\n\\nFor everyone else, save yourself the time and embarrassment of even knowing that this show exists and go watch 'American Beauty' again, or 'Freaks and Geeks', or 'Six Feet Under', or 'My So Called Life'.\\n\\nThis show is trying so hard to be '13 Reasons Why', and failing miserably on all counts. Yes, I know, '13 Reasons Why' came afterwards, but the similarities are uncanny. ...Formulaic moody voice-over protagonist examining laughably clich\\u00e9 and shallow life-lessons at the start of each episode with an ongoing 'dark' mystery that I have literally no interest in discovering 'who the killer is'... ...This is, quite literally, the g-rated version of '13 Reason Why'. The baby brother that should have been aborted long ago.\\n\\nI'm hate watching this show just to laugh at how bad the writing is, and how over-the-top the actors are in reading the lines. I genuinely feel sorry for all of the cast involved, since they are all stunningly gorgeous, late 20-somethings, for what is supposed to be a high school drama.\\n\\nA lot of investment has gone into the production values, episode direction and 'Glee'-like songs, but that doesn't make up for the horribly predictable 1 bit characters.\\n\\nI guess, since this is based on a terribly banal comic strip, that I'm supposed to look the other way, and expect it to just be a skin- deep romp. Like watching the movie-version of 'Battleship', knowing, and accepting, that there isn't any real substance underlying the content of what the show is originally based off of.\\n\\nIt's a shame really. I feel like this could have been something, had there been just ever so slightly a bit more comedy and charm worked into the characters. The only saving grace is Betty's gay best friend, who provides a strikingly blunt and hilarious perspective at times, and is seemingly always down to rave. He is a teen version of 'Elijah' from 'Girls'.\\n\\nContrast him, with the main character Archie. ... Archie is the most hatable character, despite always having the smoothest things to say to work him out of the most terribly awkward situations. He never lies to anyone, but it's laughable how everyone fawns over his presence and excuses his poor decisions.\\n\\nFor instance, one minor plot spoiler here... I find it really hard to watch and empathize with a high school football captain jock, who friend zones his smoking hot best friend while in the process of having a scandalous affair with his music teacher. Oh, and when his love triangle explodes, everyone gives him a pass with even his father basically patting him on the back and saying 'it's not your fault'. Really? It's not? Are you sure? Something feels terribly off about the entire ordeal.\\n\\nA. He's dating a teacher. While this has been done before in other shows, 'Boston Public' comes to mind... ...Here it feel very... very... wrong and superficial. In one episode he acknowledges that he's just having fun with her and celebrating the present with little regard to what repercussions their relationship may have on his family\\/friends\\/her career. In the next, he's demanding commitment, and then parting ways with her while gifting her a cello string.\\n\\nI guess, we're supposed to roll our eyes and accept it. But there's something very cringe-worthy in doing that, as it is with so many other aspects of this show (such as, watching cheerleaders twerk to a hiphop remixed song of 'sugar sugar').\\n\\nThere's a very no-good, terrible vibe, underlying this entire show, Laughing off very real subjects with terrible dialogue, predictable plot twists, and glitzy dance numbers.\\n\\n...And now I've written too much about a show that isn't worth my spit.

Unfortunately, the Dutch television companies don't know anything about good programming. Most television series are cut short during the season so that the second part of the season can be shown the next year. Sometimes when they stop mid season, the rest of the episodes aren't shown at all and they start all over again. This is one of the reasons that I don't watch series on Dutch television. I usually rent or borrow the DVD's. Although we get to see most popular HBO series (Carniv\\u00e0le, Sopranos, Six Feet Under) I never watch them on television. Although I'd never seen the show, I decided to buy the DVD after reading some reviews. Thank God I did!\\n\\nDeadwood is a very very good show. The setting of this drama is the town in the title. Deadwood is a town where there is no law and where anything goes. Seth Bullock, sheriff in Montana and his partner Sol Star, decide to leave Montana and depart for Deadwood after hanging their last prisoner. When arriving in Deadwood they set out to buy some property so that they can build their hardware store. Before they've actually purchased the ground, you've met all characters including E.B. Farnum (hotel owner), Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane. This show's strong point is its character driven storyline. The characters are so well cast that you have no problem accepting them. The foul mouth of Al Swearengen, the short temper of Bullock or the preaching's of the reverend are features that you'll come to love. All characters have certain features that you love about them, even the bad guys. In addition, all characters have certain features you really hate, even the good guys. \\n\\nThis show is so well written that you'll be on the edge of your seat with suspense or you'll be laughing your ass off because of the brilliant and funny lines. An example; Commissioner Jarry has been imprisoned to keep him safe from a mob. Calamity Jane is guarding him.\\n\\nJarry: I'm thirsty! Jane: Lie on your back, take aim and p!ss!\\n\\nThis show has so many great lines that it is hard to pick a favorite. One thing people might not like about the show is the amount of swearing. Some may think it's too much but I'm not bothered by the amount of swearing. Most great lines are delivered with a couple of swear words and yes you'll get used to the swearing and I found myself even using some of them on my friends... Euhmm, anyway, about the language, some may also have problems following the show because of the use of Western Period English. My native tongue is Dutch and although my English is pretty good (don't have to watch movies with subs :P) I had a hard time following the show without the English subtitles. I don't have problems with the English itself, but a lot of the dialogue is very specific for the period. Words like, Hooplehead, Squarehead and sentences like \\\"My bicycle masters boardwalk and quagmire with aplomb\\\" got me stumped for a while. Just turn on the subtitles or you might miss some of the amazing dialogue.\\n\\nOne last thing about this show. The last episode of season 1 has to be the best finale to a season I've ever seen! Sold Under Sin is so good you'll certainly shed a tear.\\n\\nThis show is brilliant! Just, brilliant!\\n\\n10 out of 10 stars.\",\"NP\":[[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"fan\",\"NN\"]],[[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"Dutch\",\"JJ\"],[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"programming\",\"NN\"]],[[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"second\",\"JJ\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"next\",\"JJ\"],[\"year\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mid\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"rest\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"setting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"drama\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"town\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"title\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"town\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"law\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sheriff\",\"NN\"]],[[\"partner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"decide\",\"NN\"]],[[\"depart\",\"NN\"]],[[\"last\",\"JJ\"],[\"prisoner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"property\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hardware\",\"NN\"]],[[\"store\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"ground\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hotel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"owner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"strong\",\"JJ\"],[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"storyline\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"problem\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"foul\",\"JJ\"],[\"mouth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"short\",\"JJ\"],[\"temper\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"preaching\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"reverend\",\"NN\"]],[[\"addition\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"edge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"seat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"suspense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ass\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"brilliant\",\"NN\"]],[[\"An\",\"DT\"],[\"example\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"mob\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Jarry\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Jane\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Lie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"back\",\"NN\"]],[[\"aim\",\"NN\"]],[[\"p\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ss\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"favorite\",\"NN\"]],[[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"amount\",\"NN\"]],[[\"swearing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"amount\",\"NN\"]],[[\"swearing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"couple\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"swearing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"language\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"use\",\"NN\"]],[[\"native\",\"JJ\"],[\"tongue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"hard\",\"JJ\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"dialogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"period\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bicycle\",\"NN\"]],[[\"aplomb\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"while\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"amazing\",\"JJ\"],[\"dialogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"last\",\"JJ\"],[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"last\",\"JJ\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"finale\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"tear\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Too Old to Die Young\",\"reviewText\":\"NWR transports us to that unique universe that he demonstrated previously in his films.

Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\\n\\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\\n\\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface.

In the film of the same name, he goes back into action shooting up bad guys in a city where it seems that the cops have all simultaneously taken a vacation. Played by surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian Keanu Reeves, John Wick's style of shooting baddies is reminiscent of my days playing Whac-A-Mole, Duck Hunt, or any of those arcade games with the plastic guns. Wick is a vengeant superman, and this is the basis of the entire movie. Although he doesn't have a clear weakness that can be exploited like most heroes, Wick does get into enough trouble for the audience to be sincerely worried about him. \\n\\nIf you're planning on seeing John Wick because you like movies with clever or meaningful story lines, then you're going to be disappointed. If you are looking for raw well- choreographed action and machismo, then look no further. House Greyjoy's Alfie Allen stands out as villainous Russian mafia brat Iosef Tarasov, and Michael Nyqvist (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) plays Viggo, his mob boss father. Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane and Dean Winters round out a strong supporting cast. \\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed John Wick as a pure action film. It doesn't have a storyline like The Matrix or Speed, but it was visually entertaining and the simplicity of the story allowed for appreciation of the action. This movie is manly and primitive, and proves that at the age of 50, Keanu Reeves can still mix it up as an action star.\",\"NP\":[[[\"retired\",\"JJ\"],[\"legendary\",\"JJ\"],[\"hit-man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bad\",\"JJ\"],[\"side\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"name\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"city\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"vacation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"plastic\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"vengeant\",\"JJ\"],[\"superman\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"basis\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"entire\",\"JJ\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"clear\",\"JJ\"],[\"weakness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"enough\",\"JJ\"],[\"trouble\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"clever\",\"NN\"]],[[\"meaningful\",\"JJ\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"raw\",\"JJ\"],[\"well-\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"machismo\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"further\",\"NN\"]],[[\"villainous\",\"JJ\"],[\"Russian\",\"JJ\"],[\"mafia\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mob\",\"NN\"]],[[\"boss\",\"NN\"]],[[\"father\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"strong\",\"JJ\"],[\"supporting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"pure\",\"JJ\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"storyline\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"simplicity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"appreciation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"age\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"star\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Bad Times at the El Royale\",\"reviewText\":\"So intriguing to start and then wastes all of its potential.

The film's old-fashioned color palette, low-key charms, and leisurely pacing feel like a throwback to classic filmmaking in a manner almost never seen in today's modern films, even independent ones. It's impossible not to smile at Redford and Spacek's charisma, and the simple score is charming and lovely. The film certainly has its fair share of amusing and entertaining moments, many of which involve bank robbery attempts and prison escapes. That said, the movie has some noticeable problems with its narrative.\\n\\nThe main problem with the film's story is not that it is contrived (it can be, but it is not too difficult for the viewer to suspend disbelief while watching this film.) Rather, it is that the film can be repetitive. The film's use of montages and similar plot devices (like juxtapositions of bank robbery scenes followed by subsequent juxtapositions of scenes showing the personal lives of major characters) get too repetitive, so much that it is somewhat difficult to feel impacted by their stylistic role in the narrative. For a movie that only lasts a fleeting 93 minutes, the film oddly feels a bit long as well. These narrative issues are (unfortunately) very structural in terms of how they affect the film as a whole, which can be judged by the viewer against the film's positive elements (the performances, simple aesthetics, and tone.)

So when I finished binging it about 2 years ago, I started watching Better Call Saul immediately afterwards. Hoping to latch onto it as a way to keep Breaking Bad alive. In some ways, the show succeeds in doing that, but it is very much it's own thing too. Focusing on the story of how Saul Goodman came to be.\\n\\nTo be honest, spinoffs almost never work well. To give one example, The Walking Dead's spin-off, FTWD, was a decent show, that never lived up to its potential. That changed in season 4, as the reboot breathed new life into it, but the point remains, it started as a relative failure. I was nervous BCS would end up being the same, but was I wrong. Better Call Saul I find to be an actual good spinoff. This is rare. That being said, the show is still not of Breaking Bad quality. That is an unrealistic expectation, however, because spinoffs *never* live up to or exceed the original. Going back to my example of TWD and FTWD, or the Star Wars OT and the Sequel Trilogy, etc. This will even likely be the case for the MCU after Avengers 4. To get back on topic, even though it isn't equal to Breaking Bad, the show is still definitely worthwhile. If you loved Breaking Bad, you should at the very least be able to find something to like about this show.\\n\\nThe main problem I find with this series is the pacing. This is one of the slowest paced shows that I have ever watched. Slow pace is not always a bad thing, in fact I advocate for it because it gives us more time to connect with the characters, such as when it's used in the parent program, or TWD, etc. Better Call Saul lays it on a little too thick I feel. Sometimes, because of this slow pace, the show might feel a little aimless. If you can get past that, it tells a compelling story about the descent of a man. As well as offering interesting hints as to what happens to Saul after the events of Breaking Bad.\\n\\nBob Odenkirk portrays Jimmy McGill's descent to Saul Goodman spectacularly. It really is a treat to watch. All of the other main actors are great as well. And it's enjoyable to spot Breaking Bad Easter eggs, as well as to see characters from the show brought onto this one. Such as Mike, Gus, Hector, etc.\\n\\nOverall, BCS is a good show that can stand on its own.

Robin Lord Taylor's portrayal of Penguin in particular is the standout performance, however virtually every villain, the riddler, joker, poison ivy, scarecrow etc, are perfectly portrayed, and certainly stand as the highlights of the series as a whole. However there is a strong philosophical message inherent within the show, beyond the action and flare, about law and order, justice, moral lines, and the greater good. The storytelling is another aspect the show perfectly nails. It isn't easy to nail an amalgamation of different narratives to create coherent television, however Gotham succeeds, engrossing the audience with its emotional resonance, and creativity. However, despite being one of my favorite shows of all time, Gotham isn't without its flaws. There is sometimes an excessive reliance on filler and \\\"too much\\\" substance which prevents the narrative of the series to flow more smoothly, and occasionally bogs down the pacing of the series as a whole. Furthermore there are sometimes one too many plot elements which slow down the series resolution, and prevents the series from spending more time on critical and more intriguing story elements. However despite the flaws inherent within Gotham, the series has all the elements which make engrossing television. Interesting characters, an engrossing narrative, and a central element which always pulls the audience to watch more, the city of Gotham, which in and of itself, with its enigma, visual beauty, and dilemas, stands as a character in and of itself.\",\"NP\":[[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"only\",\"JJ\"],[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"perfect\",\"JJ\"],[\"rating\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"fact\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"flawless\",\"NN\"]],[[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"phase\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"massive\",\"JJ\"],[\"understatement\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"brooding\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"exciting\",\"JJ\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"portrayal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"standout\",\"NN\"]],[[\"performance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"villain\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"riddler\",\"NN\"]],[[\"joker\",\"NN\"]],[[\"poison\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ivy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"scarecrow\",\"NN\"]],[[\"etc\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"whole\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"strong\",\"JJ\"],[\"philosophical\",\"JJ\"],[\"message\",\"NN\"]],[[\"inherent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"flare\",\"NN\"]],[[\"law\",\"NN\"]],[[\"order\",\"NN\"]],[[\"justice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"storytelling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"another\",\"DT\"],[\"aspect\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"amalgamation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"coherent\",\"JJ\"],[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"emotional\",\"JJ\"],[\"resonance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"creativity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"all\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"excessive\",\"JJ\"],[\"reliance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"filler\",\"NN\"]],[[\"substance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"narrative\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"pacing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"whole\",\"NN\"]],[[\"many\",\"JJ\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"resolution\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intriguing\",\"JJ\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"central\",\"JJ\"],[\"element\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"city\",\"NN\"]],[[\"enigma\",\"NN\"]],[[\"visual\",\"JJ\"],[\"beauty\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dilemas\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Dexter\",\"reviewText\":\"This is going to be my first ever review on IMDb, there is not a day when I do not visit IMDb to check the reviews about movies or TV series that I watch, I watch lots of movies and series.\\n\\nFor the first time in my life it happened to me that I could not sleep after watching a series.

If there's a Harley and black leathers in the shot -- bad guys killing and doing bad things -- their work is done. Not so with Sons Of Anarchy.\\n\\nWhile you will find all of the above elements, they're woven into a much richer fabric that brings each and every character to life in 16 million colors and full resolution, rising above the stereo-typical black-and-white portrayals of VGA-rendered knuckle-dragging villains.\\n\\nAnd the casting! Katy Segal is phenomenal as Gemma, the widow of club founder and wife of present club runner, Clay Morrow, played by Ron Pearlman. Gemma's son, Jax, played by Charlie Hunnam, butts heads with his step-father's vision for the club.\\n\\nBut what really sets this biker drama apart is the context. The bikers are all natives of Charming, childhood friends in a small town. They've kept the town free of corporate tentacles and development, partly so they can run their legal and illegal businesses free of interference (gun-running and porn), and partly because the town itself might as well be a club member. The characters have deep roots to the townspeople who fear but also trust them to a degree, at least in the sense that it's sometimes better to deal with the devil you know and sometimes it's even handy to know the devil. The Sons have 'profitable arrangements' with certain local law enforcement officials, including the Chief of Police played magnificently by Dayton Callie, better known as Deadwood's Charlie Utter.\\n\\nConflict arises from neighboring clubs, gangs and criminal organizations trying to horn in on the action, and to an Aryan businessman and politician, played by Alan Arkin, who wants to set up shop in Charming and take out the Sons of Anarchy so he can take their place at the top of the criminal heap.\\n\\nAs if this wasn't fodder enough, Ally Walker joined the cast in season two as ball-breaking FBI agent June Stahl, going after the Sons and IRA gun runners who are selling to the Sons. Her quest, made painfully personal, by a meeting-gone-wrong with an imprisoned club member.\\n\\nThe action is gritty, the anti-heroes are plentiful, the characters are full-bodied and the writing is Class-A.

The scenery added so much emotion and intensity giving you the sense that every detail was intentional, every moment precious. The makers of this series had seemingly high aspirations and delivered with PERFECTION. \\n\\nI have such a newfound appreciation for Nicole Kidman and assure you that in watching this your opinion of her will change! Her subtlety and restrain were masterful. She is truly an INCREDIBLE actress and it's not because she has a pretty face, it's because she is a master communicator of the human condition. One of the best performances of the year and of her career. Witherspoon was a bit annoying but good. Shailene Woodley is very convincing and arguably the heart of this series, although I've never been particularly fond of her. The rest of the cast, even down to the children, are just as great, especially Laura Dern (one of my favorites). I do wish Dern and Zoe Kravitz (a true wildcard and perhaps the most beautiful young actress of her time) got more screen time. \\n\\nI left this series wanting desperately for more and would love for the folks at HBO to build on this story.

Back when shows prioritized the characterizations above the action and, if indeed there was action, it took place precisely in the last 7 minutes of the episode, and was all done with before the close, giving the characters a chance to make light comic banter, close down the storyline, and give the audience a chance to go to the toilet. How many TV shows followed that formula I cannot say, but the number was in the 100s. Now all that has changed. You can now have action many times in the body of a show, it is permitted, even encouraged. And you have action even before the characterizations are fully developed. All this is positive evolution I think. But here the catch. There are no more \\\"closed\\\" story-lines. In the multi-band, multi-channel, multi-device electronic age, where viewers tend to have attention span of a hummingbird, nighttime TV has astonishingly borrowed the Rule Book of daytime soap operas and, lo!, plots never actually resolve, they just become more complex. ARROW is one of the best exponents of the new type of comic-book-derived drama, arguably as good as or even better than SMALLVILLE (which was, thematically, all over the map). Amell is great. He has a whispery kind of delivery which oddly makes what he says that much more interesting. The supporting cast is great. In fact the only thing that prevented me from giving this a \\\"10\\\" are the flashbacks. They are terrible.

However I kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and Keanu, I thought I would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shot.\\n\\nThe movie had two ex-stunt men (one of which was Keanu Reeves' former stunt double) helming this film. This resulted in a lot of practical effects instead of heavy reliance on green screen. Also familiarity with Reeves likely left the directors with a base knowledge with how far they could push the star. This left the film's action scenes clean, realistic, to the point, and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.\\n\\nIf I was going to break down the film's format, well it is of the \\\"semi-generic Punisher type, ex bad ass comes out of retirement to take on other bad asses\\\" type variety. It was 75% Japanese yakuza film, 20% Film Noir, and 5% video game. One stylistic element that jumped out at me right away was the choice to go with a narrow scope of field for focus. At first I thought maybe this was the projector in the theater but then I realized it was a choice made for the film. Normally this would annoy me slightly, and I suppose still did, as I am a big fan of depth of field, mise\\u2013en\\u2013sc\\u00e8nes set ups (Citizen Kane is one of my favorite films). I came to terms with the stylistic choice made for this film as it reminded me so much of Eastern influences, in this case it was reminiscent of Zen ink and brush compositions, where the sharpness lies in where the brush first touches down and the edges disappear into an almost mist like effect.\\n\\nWhile Keanu sold the action pieces well, he wasn't asked to do too much to stretch his stoic emotional range, which is just what the film required. He was pretty much perfect for this part if I had been for some reason been asked to recast this film, I would be hard pressed to find a better fit. This would have been right up Jason Statham's alley, however there is nothing more he could have added to it. There was something quietly instance about Reeves that made you feel that he was one not to be trifled with. Statham will always remind me of the character he played in Snatch, which was not at all overly menacing or intimidating. Rather, if I had my choice of an alternative, I would delve further into the Japanese gangster genre and extract Chow Yun-fat. Reeves was 49 in this film and still convincing as an ass kicker. Chow Yun-fat would have been ten years older, but that would have further added to the realism of a retired hit man that is unwillingly dragged back into the 'business'.\\n\\nSpeaking of performances, this film was full of great character actors from the action genre and otherwise. One of these performances that I was not overly fond of was that of Alfie Allen. You probably know him as the dickless Theon Greyjoy. He worked in the part in that he was highly unlikable, however I was not sure which accent he was trying to commit to. This brings me to another flaw of the film. Many of the baddies simply did not measure up to be worthy of the John Wick challenge. A spoiled brat son of a crime boss nor the crime boss himself, an old man that the film gave no hint as to any physical prowess until the anticlimactic final battle gave any feeling that the fight would go any other direction except to a single minded John Wick killing stroke.\\n\\nI highly recommend this film if you are a fan of good action. This easily ranks as one of the pure action movies of 2014. Judged as just a movie, it is simple in story structure, but what it does it does very well.\\n\\nBlarv Score out of 10: 8.8\",\"NP\":[[[\"little\",\"JJ\"],[\"interest\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"opposite\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"selling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"throw\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"connection\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"director\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"shot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"former\",\"JJ\"],[\"stunt\",\"NN\"]],[[\"double\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"heavy\",\"JJ\"],[\"reliance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"green\",\"JJ\"],[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"familiarity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"base\",\"NN\"]],[[\"knowledge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"star\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"hell\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fun\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"format\",\"NN\"]],[[\"type\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bad\",\"JJ\"],[\"ass\",\"NN\"]],[[\"retirement\",\"NN\"]],[[\"type\",\"NN\"]],[[\"variety\",\"NN\"]],[[\"%\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Japanese\",\"JJ\"],[\"yakuza\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"%\",\"NN\"]],[[\"%\",\"NN\"]],[[\"video\",\"JJ\"],[\"game\",\"NN\"]],[[\"stylistic\",\"JJ\"],[\"element\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"choice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"narrow\",\"JJ\"],[\"scope\",\"NN\"]],[[\"field\",\"NN\"]],[[\"focus\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"projector\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"theater\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"choice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"big\",\"JJ\"],[\"fan\",\"NN\"]],[[\"depth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"field\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"stylistic\",\"JJ\"],[\"choice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"case\",\"NN\"]],[[\"reminiscent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ink\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brush\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sharpness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"brush\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mist\",\"NN\"]],[[\"effect\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"stoic\",\"JJ\"],[\"emotional\",\"JJ\"],[\"range\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"much\",\"JJ\"],[\"perfect\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"reason\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"alley\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nothing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"instance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"menacing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intimidating\",\"NN\"]],[[\"choice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"Japanese\",\"JJ\"],[\"gangster\",\"NN\"]],[[\"genre\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"ass\",\"NN\"]],[[\"kicker\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"realism\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"retired\",\"JJ\"],[\"hit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"'business\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"genre\",\"NN\"]],[[\"overly\",\"JJ\"],[\"fond\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"dickless\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"accent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"another\",\"DT\"],[\"flaw\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"challenge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"A\",\"DT\"],[\"spoiled\",\"JJ\"],[\"brat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"son\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"boss\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"boss\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"old\",\"JJ\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"hint\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"physical\",\"JJ\"],[\"prowess\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"anticlimactic\",\"JJ\"],[\"final\",\"JJ\"],[\"battle\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"feeling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"fight\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"other\",\"JJ\"],[\"direction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"stroke\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"fan\",\"NN\"]],[[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"pure\",\"JJ\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"structure\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Bad Times at the El Royale\",\"reviewText\":\"Good: The time period 1969 provides a great stylistic approach to a hotel that has property on both California and Nevada, which adds to the idea of having a good side and a bad side and the hotel also creates a sense of entrapment. The cinematography is great as it makes slow pans to unveil the secrets of the characters and the El Royale. The hotel, costume design, and soundtrack help create a nostalgic setting. The directing and editing are also well done when incorporating sound\\/music to scenes especially when Cynthia Ervio sings. Erivo's musical performance is filled with heart and soul and helps develop the character and conveys her emotions. Other standouts are Jeff Bridges and Chris Hemsworth. Hemsworth just has a charming presence and provides the slight dark tone of his character. Bridges plays his character well as he connects with Erivo and tries to execute his actions. However, the rest of the cast have trouble making their appearance known...\\n\\nBad: At a whopping 2h 20m runtime, the film is a slow burn where it takes a painstakingly long time to make it to the end and even the finale becomes a disappointment. At times it tries to be funny, but the humor is not a standout in this film. There is a lack of emotional pull to the characters which is evident in the finale where the characters are still not fully developed.

I could not stop myself from having a blast!\\n\\nFirst and foremost, being also the first thing you notice, \\\"John Wick\\\" is self-conscious of what it is and doesn't, for not even one second, take itself more seriously than it should. Fortunately this doesn't shut out the place for character connection and empathy. People often think the two of these things exclude themselves, but that is not what I think and this movie is proof of it. It has such a genuine sense of fun and humor, so much so that you are often laughing WITH (not AT) the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters you're rooting for. I know it sounds ridiculous, but every single f***ing kill by John Wick feels exciting and liberating, it was incredible how much I was rooting for him. To this contributes some stunning, fast-and-furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenaline-pumping scenes, in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place, yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable. Furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma I could not help but root for the guy. He is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own. If all of this wasn't enough, \\\"John Wick\\\" has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possible.\\n\\nDespite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so, it isn't original, stylish or innovative enough to say: \\\"we've seen this plot before, but not quite done this way\\\".

I think given better material Zac Efron could've done great things with this role.

I agree with this, but you certainly shouldn't try to make the audience sympathise with them while barely mentioning their numerous victims and the families of those victims. That list of names slapped on the end just before the credits made me cringe. Was that all the recognition these innocent victims deserved? For me, the disappointment comes down to the fact that this movie was about one of the most prolific killers of all time and his crimes weren't depicted at all, nor were the stories of his victims.

I've read many complaints about the storyline about the german thing and that was actually really interesting because it somehow connects to BB and you can actually see what is the background. Also I think this season focuses a lot on the mental state of Jimmy and how he degrades to be finally Saul, and that's very deep. I think that the people who dropped their rating on season 4 is because they were used to some more emotion in adrenaline or something. This is all about Jimmy emotional state evolving and they are just not connecting with him. If I would not connect with him and see how his changing right in front of my eyes, this might be boring for me as well too.

I won't compare The Wire to these shows because they are not really comparable other than the fact they are some of the greatest shows ever, but are completely different. The wire isn't about drug dealing, the police, politics, or the education system, it is about the entire city of Baltimore. I'll admit The Wire isn't for everyone, it may be too violent or complex with the vast amount of characters and side stories for some, but I guarantee if you are a film and TV series lover and appreciate writing, acting, and an abundance of interesting characters, the wire is pretty much perfect in these regards. Each Season changes slightly in which facet of the city it will mainly cover, and becomes more complex as the series progresses. This show has without a doubt some of the most interesting characters, and best writing I have ever seen on a series.

By having a resounding premise of catching a notorious serial killer while trying to conceal his own identity, Dexter enters each week with a new sociological dilemma as well as a new criminal to dispatch. What is best about Dexter is his own personal facade of trying to be normal.

This movie didn't really work for me.\\n\\nThere are a few funny lines, mostly the ones that made the trailer, but most of the jokes don't land. Shaft and his son's constant sparring because of their generational differences is basically shoved down the audience's throats. Though Samuel L. Jackson and Usher do a good job of playing the two leads as they were meant to, they can't elevate the material. The character of Shaft's ex-wife (Regina Hall) also seems to have some very poorly written dialogue.\\n\\nThe whole plot is fairly predictable. The main villain is so paper thin that he might as well be a prop.\\n\\nI did think that both the opening intro to Shaft Jr. and his motivations for becoming involved in the plot's criminal investigation are well-handled. Also, the film does look nice.\\n\\nOverall, I guess that the movie's greatest flaw to me is that it is just too obvious.

If you are a fan of the series, do yourself a favor and stop watching. The Flash is really hitting it's stride if you're desperate for CW superhero shows. This season of Arrow is just a crudely stitched together collection of tumblr fanfics. \\n\\nThe characters have lost any real personality, and just serve to move the plot forward (this season is plagued by writers using half- baked concepts to push the \\\"plot\\\" forward by brute force). They frequently make decisions that defy any form of logic as well as any character traits of note. Any development that the characters have made in the past seasons has just disappeared, seemingly because they oppose Guggenheim's Mary Sue couple. Also it would be a misconception to think that the villain is the basis of any overarching plot. He's just a side note to said couple. Really this season seems to lack any direction whatsoever. It's like the writers are giving up on trying to provide any cohesive story. And to make it worse, while they could look back to some of the source material for some good ideas, they spit in its face in favor of their own rambling mess.\\n\\nAs a side-note, I feel that the length of this show has been a huge detractor from the start. Even in it's glory days, the seasons probably could have been trimmed in half or lower and tell the same story. A lot of the time on this show is wasted on silly stuff, and could it could be a huge improvement to trim down the story to something more concise and save more for the effects budget. \\n\\nBut honestly, is nobody in the studio checking up on them? Was this really looked at and approved by real people in the entertainment business? It boggles my mind that this could make it to air on such a well known show. \\n\\nThe CW's superhero shows have always been aimed at a more \\\"teeny\\\" audience, but at the levels that Guggenheim has taken it to, it seems like he would be better off writing those fanfics and letting someone with moderate respect for the story's integrity take over.

It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. \\\"Hey, that's okay\\\" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved.

I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result.

It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is.

We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough.

For that reason, I anticipate the reaction to this film will be divided, as many moviegoers simply don't like surprises or being unsure of what will happen. However, if you are a fan of Goddard's previous work, it's a safe bet that you'll like this one. I also need to talk about the cast, as they deliver an absolute treasure of an ensemble performance. Each person plays their part incredibly well, but Cynthia Erivo and Chris Hemsworth are the definite stand outs. Hemsworth especially shines, showing us that he can do more than play a quippy Norse god. This movie has so much to unpack both visually and in terms of foreshadowing that I cannot wait to see it again. If you're looking for a smart, stylish, and generally thrilling way to spend a few hours, look no further than Bad Times at the El Royale.\",\"NP\":[[[\"everyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"information\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"absolute\",\"JJ\"],[\"treat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"surface\",\"NN\"]],[[\"directorial\",\"JJ\"],[\"debut\",\"NN\"]],[[\"care\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tension\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"sudden\",\"JJ\"],[\"twist\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"reason\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"reaction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"unsure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"fan\",\"NN\"]],[[\"previous\",\"JJ\"],[\"work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"safe\",\"JJ\"],[\"bet\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"cast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"absolute\",\"JJ\"],[\"treasure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"ensemble\",\"JJ\"],[\"performance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Each\",\"DT\"],[\"person\",\"NN\"]],[[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"definite\",\"JJ\"],[\"stand\",\"NN\"]],[[\"god\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"smart\",\"NN\"]],[[\"way\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"The Blacklist\",\"reviewText\":\"I've been looking forward to James Spader's return to the small screen since Boston Legal. and just finished watching last episode at http:\\/\\/www.trailerdb.net as always Mr Spader has chosen well the show to return with, it is a fascinating series about a mastermind criminal turning himself in to the FBI with a list of criminals that are pulling strings all over the world, the people behind the criminals.\\n\\nThe termination of Dexter and Breaking bad has left very little to watch on television but I can't help but to be hopeful with such great new shows taking their places. \\n\\nI am a big fan of Mr Spader and I can't wait for the next episodes.

There have been a few shows that were \\\"bleh\\\" in the last season but the \\\"SWAK\\\" episode tonight really got a few great moments of emotion between the cast members. The writers (at least to me) were able to pull off the \\\"suspended disbelief\\\" and I got pulled into the moment as DiNozzo was about to kick the bucket. I sure hope they keep most of the cast in the next season, as they seem to play off each other brilliantly. The only cast member I could see losing (according to the season finale preview, they lose an NCIS agent) is McGee. He's great and believable for his role, but any of the others lost as regulars on the show would break down the core character interplay. The McGee character could be replaced...but the others would be much more difficult. But then again I guess this is all decided and in the can...we'll find out on May 24th. My comments to other viewers that have commented on the reality of the series --- yeah, it's not the real life NCIS at all. But real life would be mind-numbingly boring to fit in 60 minute TV show. You'd need the constant buzz of fluorescent lights in the background combined with pages and pages of forms being typed into the computer --- mostly about drug abuses by young 18 year olds. This is TV drama and a fabricated fiction. I appreciate the nod Bellesario gives to NCIS and like the show for the entertainment it is.

It's all there. The archetypes of Zeus, long-suffering Hera, oracles, sibyls, the virginal Persephone, Zeus' seduction of mere mortal women (who can be destroyed by it), the messengers and functionaries of Zeus, the wandering eye of the Most High himself, on and on it goes. AND there are the deep emotions and passions that go with it.\\n\\nGreek and Roman mythology has become so quaint to us we \\\"teach\\\" it to sixth graders and sent them to see Disney productions of Hercules as an example. (Disney doesn't tell you the one about when Hercules batters one of his wives kills her and slaughters his children--I think that's the way it goes.) The schools don't \\\"teach\\\" about the mother who chops up her own children (whom she loves) to bake in a pie to feed to the husband she hates.\\n\\nThey don't \\\"teach\\\" the crazed women who mutilate the man who scorns them. Or the girl who arranges to sleep with her own father. What passes as the Greek myths in schools is really just kind of bullshit. Or...isn't there one where Zeus makes love to a mortal woman who wants to see him in his \\\"true form\\\"? She burns up or something. Tony does that too, to the car saleswoman. What about the dancer at Bada Bing? I haven't got to the end of the art gallery girl yet.\\n\\nBut The Sopranos really approaches the bloodthirst of the Gods, their cruelty, their indifference to mere mortals...and their so, so human traits mixed in with their almost unbearable inhumanity. But don't forget they sometimes show great wisdom and kindness too. The Gods and the Sopranos mingle with us mere mortals, but we say a little prayer of thanks when they pass us by. They know things we don't.\\n\\nPersonally speaking, when I think about \\\"the mob,\\\" they seem to have the sort of reality to me (or your average Joe) of being sort of \\\"out there\\\", just like a forces of nature, and I don't ever want to get them mad at me. I know I just might brush past them every once in a while, I'm sure, but I would hardly know it. If a mobster came to me in disguise, just as the Greek Gods were used to doing with mere mortals, I hope I would treat him in a way so as not to invoke his wrath in consequence. As a child, I felt about the Greek Gods with the same sense of mystery and heightened imagination, believing they were \\\"out there\\\" and about somewhere, but one just never really got to see them up-close.\\n\\nNow, I'm pretty sure this analogy to the Gods in The Sopranos is not done purposefully by the David Chase...he might have an awareness, sure, he's incredibly smart, but he's NOT making allusions to specifics...it's not an algorithm. Or (gods help us) an homage. He's just being true to the subject material in the best way he knows how--and it's absolute dynamite. It's no surprise the Sopranos reaches directly back to the Greeks. This kind of gradiosity and passion BELONG to the Sicilian and Italian culture (Sicily was an outpost of Ancient Greece) and have done for thousands of years. For Chase NOT to \\\"go there\\\" with the violence and sexuality would not be possible. \\n\\nThe greatness of the Greco-ROMAN myths lies precisely in their depth of presenting vividly, exhaustively, splendidly, the all-too human capacity for evil (among other things). The myths are the extremes we are all capable of if pushed into passion. David Chase's genius is that he has crystalized our cultural fascination of gangsters into a mythology worthy of the Greeks. I think his take on the mob is BETTER than Puzo or Scorsese. He somehow (consciously or unconsciously, I don't know) recognized the archetypes involved, intimately, and ran with them.\\n\\nFor anyone who thinks The Sopranos glorifies violence (as one dude posting here felt), that person needs to take a survey of literature or something. God, read Shakespeare. Take a course in history. Hell, look to Iraq. We live in a violent world. Learn how to digest story and context. Constantly, the show presents the REALITY but then, always the consequences.\\n\\nThe pleasure of watching this show is that the barrier of the TV screen protects us. I think the writers are constantly reminding us of the moral dimension involved. The Sopranos is at the bottom of it, deeply moral. It's about actions, and codes. If you get hung up on the violence, you probably had better watch something else and leave it at that. Go drink some Kool Aid and chill.\\n\\nHere's a suggestion to deepen the Soprano experience. Get out the tragedies and original sources (not Edith Hamilton!) and read them, thinking of the Sopranos. And conversely, if you know the myths already and want to see them truly brought to life, think of them when you are watching The Sopranos. You'll see Zeus. You'll see Hera. You'll see all kinds of Gods.\\n\\n(Look again at his mother who wanted figuratively to eat him, just like the Titans tried to eat Olympians.) The parallels are absolutely chilling. \\n\\nIf they wanted to pack the opera houses these days, they should get all the conductors and opera directors to watch The Sopranos en masse. That might revive opera overnight. Opera houses should just go back to the beginning and revive some of those very old operas and learn a few things from the Sopranos. Opera actually began in Italy as a movement to recreate and revive the grandeur of Greek tragedy. Interesting, hm? Look what it's come to. Sad.\\n\\nPavarotti would sing a HELL of a Tony Soprano...as a Tenor of course.\\n\\nIt's too bad some people don't 'get it.' They don't see, at bottom, The Sopranos is really about moral choices and consequences; it's BEYOND entertaining (it fascinates) because it parades all the deep and dark things most of us never ever have to take resposibility for.\\n\\nIt's truly Great Drama.\",\"NP\":[[[\"mythology\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"analogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mythology\",\"NN\"]],[[\"modern\",\"JJ\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sibyls\",\"NN\"]],[[\"seduction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"eye\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mythology\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"example\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"mother\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"pie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"husband\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"girl\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"father\",\"NN\"]],[[\"kind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bullshit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"love\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"mortal\",\"JJ\"],[\"woman\",\"NN\"]],[[\"true\",\"JJ\"],[\"form\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Tony\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"car\",\"NN\"]],[[\"saleswoman\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"dancer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"art\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gallery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"girl\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"bloodthirst\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cruelty\",\"NN\"]],[[\"indifference\",\"NN\"]],[[\"unbearable\",\"JJ\"],[\"inhumanity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"wisdom\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mingle\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"little\",\"JJ\"],[\"prayer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"mob\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sort\",\"NN\"]],[[\"reality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sort\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nature\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"while\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"mobster\",\"NN\"]],[[\"disguise\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"wrath\",\"NN\"]],[[\"consequence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"child\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mystery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"imagination\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pretty\",\"JJ\"],[\"sure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"analogy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"awareness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"algorithm\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"homage\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"subject\",\"JJ\"],[\"material\",\"NN\"]],[[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"absolute\",\"JJ\"],[\"dynamite\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"surprise\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"kind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gradiosity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"passion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Italian\",\"JJ\"],[\"culture\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"outpost\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"violence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sexuality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"greatness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"depth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"all-too\",\"JJ\"],[\"human\",\"JJ\"],[\"capacity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"passion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"genius\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cultural\",\"JJ\"],[\"fascination\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"mythology\",\"NN\"]],[[\"worthy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"take\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"mob\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"violence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dude\",\"NN\"]],[[\"person\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"survey\",\"NN\"]],[[\"literature\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"course\",\"NN\"]],[[\"history\",\"NN\"]],[[\"look\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"violent\",\"JJ\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"context\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"pleasure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"barrier\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"moral\",\"JJ\"],[\"dimension\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"bottom\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"violence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"watch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"chill\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"suggestion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"experience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"think\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mother\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"opera\",\"NN\"]],[[\"opera\",\"NN\"]],[[\"masse\",\"NN\"]],[[\"opera\",\"NN\"]],[[\"overnight\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Opera\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"beginning\",\"NN\"]],[[\"old\",\"JJ\"],[\"operas\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"movement\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"grandeur\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Greek\",\"JJ\"],[\"tragedy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hm\",\"NN\"]],[[\"course\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bottom\",\"NN\"]],[[\"entertaining\",\"NN\"]],[[\"resposibility\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Catch-22\",\"reviewText\":\"Catch-22 is one of my favorite books of all time and I've been waiting for this mini-series with great anticipation. Unfortunately, the writers of the episode screenplays missed the mark by more than Yossarian's mis-dropped bombs. I have to question whether the writers ever read the novel because it sure doesn't seem like it. This series could easily have had a different title if they'd just changed the character names. They did an incredibly poor job of developing the characters - after chopping most of them out for clarity's sake (I guess) - and failed to weave them appropriately into the storyline.\\n\\nThe Mike Nichols 1970 film was too far over-the-top but at least it captured the essence of absurdity that runs rampant in the novel.

After finishing this series without satisfying my Catch-22 Craving, I immediately streamed the 1970 film and I've decided to re-read the novel, which is probably the 6th time I'll read the whole thing.

I have to say based on the 2 episodes that have aired so far I have to say it has not disappointed and if the show continues to be this good then I will have another perfect show in my watchlist.\\n\\nIt has been great to see Saul Goodman (Jimmy McGill as he is known here) back to his roots, here we see a very different version of the character as a down on his luck lawyer as opposed to the criminal lawyer who handed Jesse Pinkman bags of dollars without a care in the world, yet his charm and his cocky persona and sometimes hilarious one liners stay exactly where we want them. The tone also feels very different to breaking bad. We get to see a much more lighthearted approach to this series.\\n\\nWe also get glimpses of Mike Ermantraut (Jonathan Banks) which was great and whilst so far we haven't seen a lot of him i am certain we will get a lot more interaction between the two (he is second billed in the titles afterall). I was also surprised to see another fan favourite although i wont spoil this for those who don't know.\\n\\nAs the series goes on i will post about my opinions more but i feel this show is great and will continue to go up and be on par with Breaking Bad. Vince Gilligan has proved himself as a force to be reckoned with. Better Call Saul is not only awesome as a spin off, but in its own right as a show also.

Jackson SHAFT (the sequel to the original 1971 Richard Roundtree SHAFT)? Did you remember there WAS a 2000 version of SHAFT? Do you remember the 1971 SHAFT?\\n\\nDoesn't matter.\\n\\nThe makers of this film certainly don't remember those films for - besides casting Jackson and Roundtree - there is no similarity to either of these films.\\n\\nThe first SHAFT was a Blacksploitation film starring Roundtree with mucho gunfire and bloodshed and SHAFT 2000 (as I'll call it) is a full on action flick with Jackson as Roundtree's nephew fighting crime. SHAFT 2019 is none of these - the Samuel L. Jackson Shaft is now the SON of Richard Roundtree and partners with his son JJ ,John Shaft, Jr. (played by Jessie T. Usher) to investigate the death of his friend.\\n\\nOkay...fine. I can forgive the change in tone and the \\\"tweak\\\" (I'm being generous) to the timeline. What I can't forgive is the weak script (why write any good, or interesting, dialogue when we can have all of the characters say Samuel L. Jackson's signature motherf*^#er over and over) by 3 different writers (never a good sign) that were all, clearly, just in it for the paycheck.\\n\\nJessie T. Usher (he played Will Smith's son in the also ill-advised sequel to INDEPENDENCE DAY) is a bland lead with no gravitas and no swagger that starts out young and naive and is supposed to develop (under the tutelage of his father) street smarts but, really, just becomes annoying.\\n\\nRegina Hall (GIRLS TRIP), Titus Welliver (BOSCH), Method Man (!) and Luna Lauren Velez (DEXTER) are all sleepwalking through underwritten roles just counting the minutes until they can take their paychecks to the bank.\\n\\nAt the heart of all of this \\\"missed opportunities\\\" is Director Tim Story (RIDE ALONG) he directs this film like he has someplace else to be, never missing an opportunity to be obvious (for example, JJ's friend - Karim - who's death sparks what passes for a plot in this film - might as well be walking around with a \\\"Dead Man Walking\\\" sign on him). Story's direction is lazy (and that's doing injustice to the word lazy) and obvious with no spark of ingenuity or imagination to be found.\\n\\nAnd then there's Samuel L. Jackson as SHAFT. He defines the term \\\"sleepwalking through the picture\\\" looking bored and uninterested throughout and HE'S THE BEST THING IN THE FILM! Thank goodness his charisma and charm ooze out of him without really trying - for he didn't really try here.\\n\\nSave 2 hours of your life - skip SHAFT - you'll be glad you did.\\n\\nLetter Grade: C\\n\\n4 Stars (out of 10) and you can take this to the Bank(ofMarquis)\",\"NP\":[[[\"clamoring\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"sequel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"year\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sequel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"version\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"similarity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gunfire\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"flick\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nephew\",\"JJ\"],[\"fighting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"none\",\"NN\"]],[[\"son\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"death\",\"NN\"]],[[\"friend\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Okay\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fine\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"change\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tweak\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"timeline\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"weak\",\"JJ\"],[\"script\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dialogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"signature\",\"NN\"]],[[\"motherf*^\",\"NN\"]],[[\"er\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"sign\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"paycheck\",\"NN\"]],[[\"son\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ill-advised\",\"JJ\"],[\"sequel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bland\",\"JJ\"],[\"lead\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"swagger\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"tutelage\",\"NN\"]],[[\"father\",\"NN\"]],[[\"street\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"bank\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"heart\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"someplace\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"opportunity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"example\",\"NN\"]],[[\"friend\",\"NN\"]],[[\"death\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Dead\",\"JJ\"],[\"Man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sign\",\"NN\"]],[[\"direction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"injustice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"word\",\"NN\"]],[[\"lazy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"spark\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ingenuity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"imagination\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"term\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"picture\",\"NN\"]],[[\"THING\",\"NN\"]],[[\"goodness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"charisma\",\"NN\"]],[[\"charm\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ooze\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"skip\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Peaky Blinders\",\"reviewText\":\"This is my first review and I just had to do it.

The storylines are very interesting and groundbreaking.

I was amazed and pleased that they'll take on any topic within their framework. Their guest cast should be praised as well. They have a great casting director. I don't know about their history with Emmy nominations, but they should definitely be in the running. The show has a very easy going nature despite the hardness of the cast that works well and acted beautifully.  It gives a real look at society's imperfections and discriminatory ideologies.

The first reason I tuned in was simple - Mark Harmon. Second reason was, well, Michael Weatherly. David McCallum was just a really nice bonus. That being said ... I know that NCIS as it is shown on the screen is ludicrous, so is CSI and all its off shoots, but if you show what really happens in any investigation you'll chase off the audience with boredom.\\n\\nMark Harmon has brought a sense of realism to the Leroy Jethro Gibbs character to the point that my former active duty Marine husband swears up and down that Harmon MUST have been a Gunny in real life. Either this one or a previous one, he's just too good playing a senior NCO Reservist Marine and a cop. Gibbs is also a top-notch \\\"Training Officer\\\" who clearly trains all of his people to be able to step up and take control and command of a team in a moment's notice.\\n\\nMichael Weatherly has matured as an actor - I first noticed him in Dark Angel - and he has wisely chosen to let his character on the show, Anthony \\\"Tony\\\" DiNozzo, to mature at a natural rate. Slowly. He's gone from an annoying frat-like not-quite-mature man to a deep thinker and a MUCH better investigator who can handle deep cover assignments if needed. Maybe not as well Gibbs could handle it, but that sort of skill takes time and multiple assignments to be fully qualified (and by then, the Feds tend to ship you off to their Academies so you can teach what you've learned).\\n\\nCote de Pablo (Mossad Officer Ziva David) replaced Sasha Alexander (Caitlin \\\"Kate\\\" Todd) and I'm probably in the minority when I say \\\"THANK YOU\\\" to the casting department for that. I found Todd to be a rather flat, and annoying, character. Oh she had a few lines here and there that were light hearted and worth a giggle - usually at DiNozzo's expense - but for the most part she was played a little too 'boy next door, or trying to be' by Alexander. Cote, at least, has played Ziva as a very capable, and very female, Intelligence Officer. I think this is why most folks don't like Ziva, they expect a Law Enforcement officer type character but she's an Intelligence Agent. Think CIA and kick it up several notches - you don't mess with Mossad unless you have a death wish. Cote clearly realizes this and plays \\\"Officer David\\\" with that in mind.\\n\\nDavid McCallum, Doctor Donald \\\"Ducky\\\" Mallard, is always a joy to see on the screen and I love the 'quirks' David has given Ducky. I suspect there is a history behind Ducky's 'adventure stories' that could easily fill several books - and be considered too implausible to be anything but fiction. Ducky brings a human element to the position of Medical Examiner, a warmth that civilians don't think M.E.'s have but usually do. The ones I know also have wicked, if dry, senses of humor and McCallum has joyfully taken the humor route with Ducky and I, for one, appreciate it.\\n\\nAnother quirky character is, of course, Pauley Perrett's Abby Scuitto, Goth Forensic Scientist. Her portrayal of Abby is spot on as Pauley is the only person I've heard of playing a Criminal Scientist who actually has the sheepskin in the discipline. Nothing like a touch of realism to bring a character to life! Of course, people complain that Scuitto shouldn't be permitted to work in a federal job with the obvious life style she has - to you I say, HorseFeathers. If Abby were less capable at her job, she wouldn't be there as long as she has been. Nor would any of her supervisors put up with her oddities.\\n\\nNow to speak of the other \\\"Geek\\\" on the team - Timothy McGee. Techno-geek. Keyboard Wizard. Sean Murray needs to do only one thing to make me totally happy with his character and his protrayl of McGee-cut his hair! I realize that the McGee character has a life outside of NCIS - as a published novelist no less - and probably keep his hair on the long side to emphasize his Authorial Air but... I hate the way it's flopped in his face this past season.\\n\\nThe writing on this show, like others, is usually tight but like other shows there are episodes where the writing was clearly 'off' when the idea was dreamt up or the script approved.

Most of the actual humor (dark, subtle, dry, crazy) and the subtle message from the book comes from the extremely clever narrative and situations and dialogues arising from them, not the other way around. This series depicts only the circumstances (and even that in general), taking (randomly?) the pieces from the book and trying to connect them using ... I don't know what (so called \\\"fillers\\\"?) but it's not functioning. It is simply not coherent. The novel Catch 22 itself is \\\"sacred\\\" and crazy as it gets (as well as every character in it). Extremely funny also (as much as war can be, that is). Read it several times, once a year at least (never gets \\\"out of fashion\\\" or becomes \\\"obsolete\\\"). However, the cinematography and casting are excellent. Choice of locations also. But I think Mr. Heller did not have a movie\\/series in mind writing it (quite the opposite of MASH). Let me make a comparison: the original Blade Runner has almost nothing to do with the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (which is all about artificial vs. natural life). P.K. Dick also did not write the script for a future movie. However, both are masterpieces in their own category. Lord of the Rings suffers from almost the same problem. In all mentioned cases literary templates are simply not suitable for anything but reader's \\\"visualization\\\". In that sense Catch 22 series is a miss, but one has to appreciate the guts for attempting. Just read the book, and you'll remember it the rest of your life (and come back to it).

Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy \\/ Angel mainstay Julie Benz).\\n\\nDexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill.

This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).\\n\\nAnother thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones.

But many of these folks have been written with serious personal problems of one sort of another. Midsomer is delightful both for its gently humorous picture of English village life and for the wise old philosopher king, DCI Tom Barnaby, played by John Nettles. His character brings considerable intelligence, patience and humor to the job of teaching a succession of junior officers how to avoid jumping to conclusions - and while he doesn't get to spend as much time as he'd like to with his lovely family, the show mostly avoids the dysfunctional-family issues that beset many policemen in most places.\\n\\nWe haven't seen half enough of Midsomer in the US (BBC America's Monday Night Mystery show is (sob!) long gone and Masterpiece doesn't completely specialize in mysteries though I see Poirot is back just now). I am therefore, now that I've invested in a Roku box, delighted to see that the show is still in production and that a huge number of episodes we haven't seen are online.

There were a few funny dynamics and some of the cases encountered were fairly interesting. However, as time went on I found the show to become increasingly more gimmicky and unrelatable. Each new episode involved the team to investigate a murder that occurred in some new niche that was far too extreme, in my opinion. The people didn't feel like real people, they were all defined by a single trait (artisan businesses, mole people, Amish life). \\n\\nIt all felt fake. Especially the \\\"lovable\\\" characters of our investigative team, or \\\"squints.\\\" Characters were given specific traits at what was convenient for the writers. Bones will be ultra- competitive, but it will be only noticeable in this episode. Or the death has something to do with something fairly obscure? Don't worry, this character has some background knowledge on this for no reason whatsoever. There just is no consistency in the characters. What made the whole thing worse was the inclusion of the interns in season 3 or 4(?) which only served to be a gimmick. It gives you the depressed one, the cocky one, the country one, the super smart one; extremes that just don't exist in the real world. And each one will have a dark back story for the purpose of drama that will just distance the characters farther and farther from the real world. \\n\\nAfter realizing how incredibly ridiculous each character was, I chose to stick it through and just watch this show for what it is; a crime show. Watch the squints as they solve crimes through complex and interesting cases. But then there was an obvious pattern. Unlike most crime shows which shows how a series of events lead to capturing the killer, Bones provides a much simpler solution. Booth and Brennan will investigate and investigate until they find a small detail in the bones (a nick or grooving) that they somehow hadn't noticed until the last ten minutes of the show that miraculously solves the case for them. The first fifty feel pointless because of this.\\n\\nSuffice it to say, I did not find this show enjoyable and can barely get through an episode anymore without finding it completely ridiculous.

Archie sees himself as flawed, but he wants to make music his life and vocation. Betty (his best friend) sees herself as inadequate, but she wants Archie to be more than a friend. Veronica (who just moved to Riverdale), sees herself as plagued by family history and publicity, but she wants to become a better person.\\n\\nThe show is very well cast. Each actor inhabits his character.\\n\\nIn the first episode, various secrets are alluded to, promising even more complications and conflicts than were revealed in the first installment. \\n\\nMany standard themes of teen dramas are also part of this show, which may make it feel like home for some viewers. Others may grow weary of the usual tropes: the mean head cheerleader, the gay best friend, the closeted gay jock, the handsome athletic main character, the first day at the new school for the outsider. \\\"Glee\\\" explored many of them. And some of them date back to the forties, when Andy Hardy (the original inspiration for Archie comics) entertained us all with his teenage dramas.

Crime is not that easy. And, as I said before, the TV is fulled. So, we also have the \\\"true crime\\\" shows like Criminal Minds, Law And Order CI and SVU, Withouth a Trace and many more. In Law And Order CI, they usually focus on the victims, with very strong and dense cases, but someone wonders: \\\"What about the investigator itself? Does it have to be danger danger all the time or can you have some fun?\\\" If that is your question, NCIS is one of your main answers. NCIS comes from Donald P. Bellisario, the creator of the well-known series JAG. He was also a writer of several Magnum P.1 episodes. NCIS is, more than just forensics, it's a character show. It's the story of the in and out relationships of the investigators and scientists of an agency that does anything criminal tied up to the marines, thing that Bellisario liked to do also in JAG. Therefore, we can find humor, drama, love, tragedy, and some bits of US action, besides of one of the most unusual characters you can find on such genre: an 50's former marine is the leader, a goth forensics and an 86 years old Scotish M.E that talks to his corpses. If we do a season analysis on the show, we can conclude that, it has been rising to good. The first season was a bit of CSI style, everyone was just cool. But it already had the trademark humor and a good ending. Season 2 could have initially been the same case, but the end was totally surprising.

Evans' as Morse, with his deceptive appearance of innocence and naivete, works through crimes with gentle but bulldog persistence until all is sorted. Roger Allam as his stoic, staid, habit-bound chief detective is also superb in his unwavering, fatherly support of Morse throughout, is always 100% credible as a mid-level Brit copper. Anton Lesser plays his daft martinet of a superintendent as not totally stupid, but he is perfectly underwhelming on purpose as Supt. Bright(hmmm)and is much more consumed with political kissing up than he is with the drudgery of everyday police work. He leaves that to the minions. All in all, great ensemble work, with very individual and unique characterizations in all roles, and I must say that I am so pleased that PBS has not fallen into the common American TV crime show trap of extending one crime into seeming infinity, week after slogging week. Thanks to this Morse, all is saved, and solved, in each show.

It was such a great looking shot that I have been waiting eagerly to see how it looked in the actual film ever since. It did not let me down. The style this film possesses is insane. It is one of the best looking action films I have ever seen.\\n\\nThe pacing of this film is also incredible. It starts the action immediately and almost never lets up. I can't wait to see what the death count was in this film because it will be truly enormous. The only problem is when the death count is that high the film can struggle to keep the originality up. After a while each death starts to look very similar to the last, and the 50 before that, and it can even become a little tedious to watch.\\n\\nThe only other flaw I came across with the film was that John Wick is on the defence too much. Instead of being angry and on the hunt like the first two films, for the majority of the Chapter 3 he is in survival mode. Still very fun to watch, but it isn't quite the same as seeing him take brutal revenge.\\n\\nAnd the film is brutal. I could be wrong but I don't remember the first two entries in the series making me cringe in terms of violence as much. There were some very hard things to watch at times in this movie even for me, and I pride myself on handling those sorts of things fine most of the time. One of them early on got an audible gasp from the entire audience and I saw multiple people having to turn their heads to the side.\\n\\n'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' is two hours of your life that will pass by very quickly. This is as non-stop action as films get. I think this is the third best action series currently producing movies (after 'James Bond' and 'Mission Impossible'). Will it get a third one? The first entry on the trivia page suggests no, however the end of this movie suggests yes? I guess we will have to wait to find out.

The one issue i have is how short the episodes are, which means if you watch the trailer for the series you've already seen half of the first episode. There's a lot of great jokes particularly regarding the characters, each one with their own eccentric personalities, and one of the things i love about this show is that it doesn't have to play on racial stereotypes to be funny. Its got one of the most ethnically diverse casts out there but it doesn't even care because thats not who they are. for instance Terry Crews doesn't play the hardened streetwise character, he plays the hulkish desk sergeant who is absolutely terrified of guns. Seeing Terry Crews scream like a little girl and freak out trying to put a magical princess castle together is just priceless gold. Or Rosa, the extremely abrasive criminally adept cop who doesn't have an off switch for her intimidating nature. The conversations between her and the timid pushover Detective Boyle make for some great television.\\n\\n\\\"go to your happy place\\\" \\\"what is that? that sounds stupid.\\\"\\n\\nThere's also the expressionless, unreadable openly gay police captain who is anything but a gay stereotype, the sociopathically manipulative secretary who in her own words \\\"thrives on dysfunctional relationships\\\", and detective scully who is in every sense of the word a failure, smelly, lazy, unadept and just all around a horrible police officer. Andy Sandberg really is just the cherry on top of a great ensemble cast. He plays his normal goofy immature character, but he's not without his redeeming qualities. He embarrasses himself on more than one occasion but this causes people to underestimate him and his wit which he uses to actually solve crimes. This and his competitiveness with detective Santiago cause him to keep his successes just above his screw-ups, and if he didn't actually solve cases he'd probably be fired for goofing off on the job. \\n\\nOverall i want to see Peralta learn some restraint and become a bit more devious, the competitive sexual tension between Peralta and Santiago become an even more competitive relationship and for Boyle to have a life changing experience when he finally sleeps with Rosa...

The season finale alone is one of the most moving things i've seen on TV, and having rewatched it many times (the joy of tivo) i still find myself driven to tears. The dialog is fantastic, bordering on Shakespearean at times as others have pointed out. Its a shame that so many seem to be bothered by the language, perhaps i am just overly jaded. Remember though that profanity at that time was predominantly based on religion (or rather defiance of such). These days of course, hellfire and tarnation don't have quite the same effect. If the dialog were more \\\"period\\\", i imagine it would be like watching yosemite sam cast as swearengen (heaven forbid). In their translations of Kurasawa movies, Critereon has faced the same issues, and i agree with their and David Milch's choice. Stay true to the meaning and feeling, more than the literal. Especially with profanity, this is key. Profanity's entire purpose is to offend, and if it becomes through age or paradigm shift inoffensive, it loses all meaning and effectiveness. It helps bring us into the world of deadwood, and better understand and relate to the characters who live there.

Each character felt unique and engaging and that is thanks mostly to the writing but also to the acting. Chris Hemsworth's performance was one that truly astounded me. I don't want to reveal any spoilers but trust me, this role is unlike any other role he's been in. Other than Chris Hemsworth all the other actors were exceptional as well. \\n\\nNow a reason why I love this movie is that it firstly is a great, I guess you could call, a love letter to Quentin Tarrantino's films. The dialogue is very intriguing as each character seems to have something sinister hidden deep within themselves, and that is mostly expressed through the dialogue.  I loved that none of the characters were clich\\u00e9 nice guys and I like how this movie makes you feel like any character could die at any point in the movie. It keeps your attention span and never fails at doing so. I also think it's a nice break from all those reboots, remakes, sequels and adaptations that are crowding cinema's nowadays. It's great to see a unique film like this one. It's sad that there aren't that many original ideas anymore.\\n\\nOverall this movie most definitely feels like a Quentin Tarrantino fan film. And while it never reaches the level of quality as some of his better films. It does come very close to that mark in my opinion. And that is honestly a high remark especially for a less experienced film maker. All I can say is that this movie is layered with talent all throughout the movie and I'd highly recommend you go see it.\",\"NP\":[[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"truly\",\"NN\"]],[[\"talent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"director\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"moment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"pacing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"addition\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"cinematography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"single\",\"JJ\"],[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Another\",\"DT\"],[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Each\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"writing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"acting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"performance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"trust\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"other\",\"JJ\"],[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"reason\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"love\",\"NN\"]],[[\"letter\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"dialogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"each\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sinister\",\"JJ\"],[\"hidden\",\"JJ\"],[\"deep\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"dialogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"none\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"attention\",\"NN\"]],[[\"span\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"nice\",\"JJ\"],[\"break\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cinema\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"unique\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fan\",\"NN\"]],[[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"level\",\"NN\"]],[[\"quality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"mark\",\"NN\"]],[[\"opinion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"high\",\"JJ\"],[\"remark\",\"NN\"]],[[\"experienced\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"maker\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"talent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"The Blacklist\",\"reviewText\":\"Not a big fan of crime shows at all, but the pace and the punch to this show is out of the park good.

Watson is a woman whose job has become a hobby and more. As they adapt, this could lead to more interesting interactions. The police characters are skeptical and protective of their turf, yet open to help. They grudgingly admire Holmes' results.\\n\\nHolmes is also a man who has no love of conventions. It is interesting to watch him navigate his way through a society that tries to force everyone to comply with its standards. In this process, Watson acts as liaison and interpreter. As she gains more information about Holmes, she becomes more useful to him and, perhaps, more of an annoyance to him. He wants to remain an enigma so that he can keep his secrets and demons to himself. She tells him it is good to talk of one's feelings, but he will do so only if forced. One can only hope that the writers eventually create a background for Watson that is equally engaging, though she is somewhat damaged from her experience with a malpractice case. This is only the first season, so there is time for more layers to be added.\\n\\nRegarding Holmes' crime solving techniques, they are best when he interacts with suspects or witnesses. He has an eye for the truths they reveal when they are trying to hide them. Can he see his own truths as well? Wlll he find the time to deal with his own issues when the world offers so many interesting diversions for his curiosity?\",\"NP\":[[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"American\",\"JJ\"],[\"version\",\"NN\"]],[[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"requirement\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"woman\",\"NN\"]],[[\"job\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"hobby\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"police\",\"NN\"]],[[\"turf\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"love\",\"NN\"]],[[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"society\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"process\",\"NN\"]],[[\"liaison\",\"NN\"]],[[\"interpreter\",\"NN\"]],[[\"information\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"annoyance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"enigma\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"background\",\"NN\"]],[[\"experience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"malpractice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"case\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"eye\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"curiosity\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Black Spot\",\"reviewText\":\"Version of Twin Peaks with its on quirkinesses and dark secrets.

My appreciation for this show has only grown; which leads me to substantially increase my rating from the first season or two. FYI: yes, while thankfully not too hard to understand here, there is closed-captioning.\\n\\nWhy I've grown to like this show so much: While the initial season or two were rife with annoying stereotypes, as the show matured, so did the characters. Barnaby, the lead, is a nice change from the sometimes deranged, immature and annoying detectives so popular on American television today. He's a laid back intelligent fellow, with a stable marriage and a lovely grown daughter with ambitions of her own. It's also a nice change for a detective show to not rely on any ongoing marital or family strife as a prop for ramping up tension and drama. Any marital spats here are realistically mild and short-lived (except for the first season or so, when Joyce (his charmingly age-appropriate wife) too often complains about his frequent and justified absences during \\\"family\\\" moments--that was irritating, as any cop's spouse--or doctor's spouse, or fireman's spouse, would know that is part of the job; especially in a rural district with low staff numbers. I realize I'm over thinking this, but I'm glad they dropped that trope relatively early, regardless). As of season 12 Joyce is secure in her relationship with Barnaby and a woman with an active life outside of her marriage. This is a healthy relationship with mutual support and affection. Such a nice change from the usual. His \\\"sidekicks\\\" have also matured and grown more believable.\\n\\nEven better, the show has improved the mysteries and interjected a bit more dry and appropriate humor. The Barnaby of season 12 is a confident and relaxed, seasoned detective. Sure of himself and his team(unlike many shows of this ilk); willing to let others do the heavy lifting--far more realistic than an older lead detective charging off after a younger suspect--and even let someone else take the lead. By season 12 Barnaby is secure in his position and has nothing to prove to his superiors; he's good at his job without being a rigid moralistic crusader, and everyone knows it. Despite the fact that he despises office politics, he's an active part of a functioning team, and the other characters are also allowed to change, grow and mature, with character arcs that realistically portray their growing knowledge and confidence--and promotions.\\n\\nAnother thing I really like about the program (and for me a major point of appreciation for British programming in general) is that many of the characters are middle aged or elderly. The cast is composed of actors and actresses that look age-appropriate and like real people. These are not Hollywood plasticized, Botoxed and sanitized versions of the middle-aged or elderly. Victims and villains, and even those having romantic affairs look like ordinary people-in some cases very attractive ordinary people, but people with prominent laugh lines and even (gasp) gray hair. People with character. Senior citizens are actively having love affairs and sexual encounters and no one is acting shocked at their age (except perhaps a spouse or two, or maybe their grandchildren); and the writers don't treat it like a joke. \\n\\nThis show rarely makes any note about how old anyone is when they are getting up to whatever they are doing--except perhaps in admiration. What a breathe of fresh air! You do not have to suspend disbelief to accept that actor as the father of that middle aged child, or that one as the middle aged parent of that teenager, or that those people are actually married to each other and have been for 30 or 40 years, or that person was active in WWII, etc. Given some of the mysteries go back to something that happened decades or even generations before, casting age-appropriate actors matters a great deal, even if it didn't seem like an obvious thing to do anyway. (On a social level, it also demonstrates a much greater acceptance of aging and flaws in appearance. You can be attractive even with wrinkles and a saggy bum. An attitude we'd do well to emulate). Midsomer's murder demographic definitely skews older than we would assume from similar American programming. I like that very much.\\n\\nOverall a very enjoyable program with interesting and believable characters (if you can get past the first season or so) and great actors. Usually not the most challenging of mysteries, but entertaining. The quality or challenge of those mysteries can vary. In general the audience is given the same knowledge as the Detectives, so in that regard there are few \\\"cheats\\\" (I can't stand mystery shows that cheat their audiences; leaving out crucial information that only the sleuth knows). Most of the time the Detectives spell out their logic (sometimes as the show progresses, but usually at the end) in figuring out the murderer's identity and\\/or the murderer's motive. Once we know the facts and follow the Detective's logic, it makes sense--if you haven't already solved the mystery on your own.\",\"NP\":[[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"appreciation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"rating\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"closed-captioning\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"initial\",\"JJ\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"lead\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"nice\",\"JJ\"],[\"change\",\"NN\"]],[[\"immature\",\"NN\"]],[[\"American\",\"JJ\"],[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"today\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"laid\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intelligent\",\"JJ\"],[\"fellow\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"stable\",\"JJ\"],[\"marriage\",\"NN\"]],[[\"grown\",\"JJ\"],[\"daughter\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"nice\",\"JJ\"],[\"change\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"detective\",\"JJ\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"ongoing\",\"JJ\"],[\"marital\",\"NN\"]],[[\"family\",\"NN\"]],[[\"strife\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"prop\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tension\",\"NN\"]],[[\"drama\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"age-appropriate\",\"JJ\"],[\"wife\",\"NN\"]],[[\"frequent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"family\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"cop\",\"NN\"]],[[\"spouse\",\"NN\"]],[[\"doctor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"spouse\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fireman\",\"NN\"]],[[\"spouse\",\"NN\"]],[[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"job\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"rural\",\"JJ\"],[\"district\",\"NN\"]],[[\"low\",\"JJ\"],[\"staff\",\"NN\"]],[[\"thinking\",\"NN\"]],[[\"trope\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"secure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"relationship\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"woman\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"active\",\"JJ\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"marriage\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"healthy\",\"JJ\"],[\"relationship\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mutual\",\"JJ\"],[\"support\",\"NN\"]],[[\"affection\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"nice\",\"JJ\"],[\"change\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"appropriate\",\"JJ\"],[\"humor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"seasoned\",\"JJ\"],[\"detective\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Sure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"team\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"ilk\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"heavy\",\"JJ\"],[\"lifting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"lead\",\"NN\"]],[[\"detective\",\"NN\"]],[[\"suspect\",\"NN\"]],[[\"someone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"lead\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"secure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"position\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nothing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"job\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"rigid\",\"JJ\"],[\"moralistic\",\"JJ\"],[\"crusader\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"fact\",\"NN\"]],[[\"office\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"active\",\"JJ\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"functioning\",\"NN\"]],[[\"team\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"arcs\",\"NN\"]],[[\"growing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"knowledge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"confidence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Another\",\"DT\"],[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"program\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"major\",\"JJ\"],[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"appreciation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"British\",\"JJ\"],[\"programming\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"cast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"prominent\",\"JJ\"],[\"laugh\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gasp\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gray\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hair\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"one\",\"NN\"]],[[\"age\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"spouse\",\"NN\"]],[[\"grandchildren\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"joke\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"note\",\"NN\"]],[[\"old\",\"JJ\"],[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"admiration\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"breathe\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fresh\",\"JJ\"],[\"air\",\"NN\"]],[[\"disbelief\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"actor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"father\",\"NN\"]],[[\"child\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"middle\",\"NN\"]],[[\"parent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"teenager\",\"NN\"]],[[\"person\",\"NN\"]],[[\"etc\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"deal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"obvious\",\"JJ\"],[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"social\",\"JJ\"],[\"level\",\"NN\"]],[[\"acceptance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"appearance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"saggy\",\"JJ\"],[\"bum\",\"NN\"]],[[\"An\",\"DT\"],[\"attitude\",\"NN\"]],[[\"murder\",\"NN\"]],[[\"demographic\",\"NN\"]],[[\"similar\",\"JJ\"],[\"American\",\"JJ\"],[\"programming\",\"NN\"]],[[\"enjoyable\",\"JJ\"],[\"program\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"quality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"challenge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"knowledge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"regard\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mystery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crucial\",\"JJ\"],[\"information\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sleuth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"logic\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"murderer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"identity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"murderer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"motive\",\"NN

While no show is perfectly written or filmed, this one is far and away better than nearly everything else. Why? Several reasons, but here are a couple. 1- More than any other drama I can think of, SOA avoids resorting to highly contrived scenes and plots. How many crime or action shows have LEO characters attempt to clear rooms with their guns held at arms length as they walk through doors and around corners without first clearing blind spots? This kind of forced stupidity absolutely strains credulity and like other viewers I hate it. Only lazy, stupid jerks write scenes like that. They assume viewers are idiots and won't notice how forced and phony the writing is. Apparently this is an old favorite method for building suspense, for giving viewers that \\\"uh oh, something bad is about to happen\\\" feeling. But such writing is transparent and insults the audience. \\n\\nSOA writers didn't do that. Their writing was almost always realistic in those areas. Sure, the characters in the show are unusual, but their behavior is believable. \\n\\nIn the same way, the writers did not resort to making most characters emotionally labile as the majority of other drama writers do. There is plenty of emotion in the show, but it is developed realistically, and most of the characters have a normal amount of emotional maturity, so the viewer is able to relate to and go along with it. \\n\\nThere is a lot more to be said for this show of course. But I was and am extremely pleased with the realism of the writing, and also of the acting. \\n\\nOne more thing which makes the show so believable and good: it was not another vehicle for \\\"political correctness\\\". The writers avoided all that phony thinking and speaking. In one episode a SOA member remarked that he had taken his son out of T ball because every member of every team was given a winner's trophy. As normal people in real life do, he recognized that the school's attempt to eliminate winners and losers is harmful to children.

Also, an autopsy shows that the corpse's neck has been wrung, like a chicken's. Bones and Booth trace the corpse to a chicken farm, which is being picketed by hipster protesters chanting, \\\"Cluck you, cluck you.\\\" Here they learn that the victim developed his chicken-like face when the farm's chicken stench caused his nasal passages to become deformed. Then, they probably solve the case. I don't know. I couldn't finish watching. I've never made it more than halfway through an episode. Not for lack of trying.\\n\\nI don't remember exactly, but the chicken episode may be the same one in which the corpse is found by a troop of girl scouts who carefully preserve it and transport it to the FBI lab on their scout bus, with the consent of their scout leader. And let me tell you, the realism left me feeling refreshed.\\n\\nThe above plot description might make it sound like this is an inspired, surreal parody of cop shows, but it isn't. If this was parody, I'd expect the actors to play it completely deadpan. Instead, they're trying to be so cute and precious that we just want to eat them up. \\n\\nThere's Bones -- whose level of social awkwardness is wildly inconsistent, depending on which writer is phoning in the gags -- and Booth, her thoroughly bland boss, and a group of thirteen year old boys disguised as lab technicians.

Definitely not for everyone but finally something that feels real.\\n\\nI personally like the fact they pull no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets. \\n\\nHow the denial and desperation that can occur to the common working stand up citizen, the pillar of society that suddenly changes his moral standing in a society driven by the almighty dollar. This is pretty dam close to Fallen (Michel Douglas) but with up to date street smarts nd a lot more punch. \\n\\nThe characters don't over exaggerate their roles and the story line isn't filled with cleaver dialog or near to impossible feats of bravery or beating impossible odds. Just true to life screwed up events that could take place in the real world. I think they did their research on this one. Good work everyone. \\n\\nI hope we get more than a second and third season out of this great crew (every one of them). From the writing and production sets to the acting, costumes, lighting, filming and originality.

Exciting! A much hyped good looking and edgy new crime drama. Can this pull me away from unsatisfactory emails and muted responses to my spontaneous Facebook posts? I relax and stare at the High Definition screen diligently.   Thrown into a dirty, industrial, post WW1 Birmingham; struggling for opportunity, devasted by the horrors of the most critical war in history and acutely aware of the quick riches to be made in vice, we follow the fortunes of the Shelby family. Ruthless, savvy and turned out with surprisingly good suits and haircuts, can their struggle satisfy the demands of my hum-drum, easily bored and passive life?\\n\\nNot short of intreague; communists, police, government forces, rival gangs, The Church, aristocracy and some mysterious Russians amongst others, all whisper, cahoot, shout, shoot, steal and kill in a violent and complex web of crime, seduction, lies and murder. \\n\\nSensorarily and emotionally you will be bombarded. Characters built up to be wholesome are mercilessly butchered and the Brummy tongue transports you away from familiar Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes cockney London into a bustling, urban population gasping for an identity of their own. Powerful performances do keep you gripped, Most notably Paul Anderson as troubled Arthur; destructively battling his demons head on, never quite finding a path to salvation. \\n\\nThe sometimes brutal deaths of innocents, not to mention the often brutal and vicious deaths of the guilty form a dark cloud over developments. Murder, near murder and beatings become common place, often uninspiringly used as a plot mechanism. The main characters, in spite of what we know about their level of involvement in the latest nefarious plan, have no release, outlet or spiritual motivation. Not one character breaks the mould of a tortured individual; paralysed either by duty or fear, reluctant moll facing a moral dilemma or a key decision maker weighing up politics and the bigger picture. And so they whisper, cahoot, shout, shoot, steal and kill into further turmoil before the grand resolution, which Shelby leader Tommy (Cillian Murphy) is burdened with all collective hope to make it good.\\n\\nWhat troubles me is that because the lead characters are so torturously greyscale, I find it hard to justify the ultraviolent, scheming and totally immoral lifestyle they choose. For every life Tommy Shelby saves countless die, some he kills with animalistic brutality by his own hands. The palpable relief felt by the audience at the end of each climax isn't that of joy, hope or victory; merely satisfaction that a tumultuous catastrophe has been averted and the characters you've been rooting for are more or less intact.\\n\\nPeaky Blinders leaves me entertained though morally perplexed. Despite its style and good acting, I feel unrewarded. It certainly distracted me from a life far removed from the Shelby post Great War Birmingham canals, though ultimately I'm no happier or informed and scarred with vivid graphic images of murder and death.\",\"NP\":[[[\"Wow\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Exciting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"edgy\",\"JJ\"],[\"new\",\"JJ\"],[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"drama\",\"NN\"]],[[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"dirty\",\"NN\"]],[[\"post\",\"NN\"]],[[\"opportunity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"critical\",\"JJ\"],[\"war\",\"NN\"]],[[\"history\",\"NN\"]],[[\"vice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"family\",\"NN\"]],[[\"savvy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"struggle\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hum-drum\",\"NN\"]],[[\"passive\",\"JJ\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intreague\",\"NN\"]],[[\"police\",\"NN\"]],[[\"government\",\"NN\"]],[[\"aristocracy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"all\",\"DT\"],[\"whisper\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cahoot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"shout\",\"NN\"]],[[\"shoot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"steal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"violent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"complex\",\"JJ\"],[\"web\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"seduction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"murder\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tongue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cockney\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bustling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"urban\",\"JJ\"],[\"population\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"identity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"path\",\"NN\"]],[[\"salvation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"guilty\",\"JJ\"],[\"form\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"dark\",\"JJ\"],[\"cloud\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Murder\",\"NN\"]],[[\"murder\",\"NN\"]],[[\"common\",\"JJ\"],[\"place\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mechanism\",\"NN\"]],[[\"spite\",\"NN\"]],[[\"level\",\"NN\"]],[[\"involvement\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nefarious\",\"JJ\"],[\"plan\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"release\",\"NN\"]],[[\"outlet\",\"NN\"]],[[\"spiritual\",\"JJ\"],[\"motivation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"mould\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"tortured\",\"JJ\"],[\"individual\",\"NN\"]],[[\"duty\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fear\",\"NN\"]],[[\"reluctant\",\"JJ\"],[\"moll\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"moral\",\"JJ\"],[\"dilemma\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"key\",\"JJ\"],[\"decision\",\"NN\"]],[[\"maker\",\"NN\"]],[[\"picture\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cahoot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"shout\",\"NN\"]],[[\"shoot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"steal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"further\",\"JJ\"],[\"turmoil\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"grand\",\"JJ\"],[\"resolution\",\"NN\"]],[[\"leader\",\"NN\"]],[[\"all\",\"DT\"],[\"collective\",\"JJ\"],[\"hope\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"lead\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"ultraviolent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"immoral\",\"JJ\"],[\"lifestyle\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"countless\",\"JJ\"],[\"die\",\"NN\"]],[[\"animalistic\",\"JJ\"],[\"brutality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"palpable\",\"JJ\"],[\"relief\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"each\",\"DT\"],[\"climax\",\"NN\"]],[[\"joy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"victory\",\"NN\"]],[[\"satisfaction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"tumultuous\",\"JJ\"],[\"catastrophe\",\"NN\"]],[[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"acting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"post\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"happier\",\"NN\"]],[[\"murder\",\"NN\"]],[[\"death\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Orange Is the New Black\",\"reviewText\":\"Well the concept of women prison is something new and I started watching it with blank mind.

Old to Die Young\",\"reviewText\":\"Imagine that you are sitting on a glacier. Next to you there is a sled being pulled by a thousand snails. On the sled is a 104-year-old man who is mumbling his dying words while you try to listen while you are also listening to insipid music because you are on hold with your phone company. You're also arguing with the plumber who said it would only take him and hour to fix your toilet and it's been four days now and he mostly just eats your food and watches Mexican wrestling while napping on your sofa. I think this is the atmosphere the director was out to create with TOTDY.\\n\\nThey even take too long to show the show's title, throwing out each word individually and very slowly so that by the time they get to the last word, you have forgotten the others. Take this title sequence as a metaphor for the series.\\n\\nWhy does it sound like a 1950s science fiction movie?\\n\\nSome episodes run 90 minutes. Are you kidding me? If people went to the cinema and paid to see a feature that gave out so little information, they would lynch the director. It's so incredibly long and stupid and says almost nothing, and what very little it does say could have lasted less then ten minutes onscreen.\\n\\nSo, I guess this is the new style in directing, call it \\\"Real Time\\\" because in an opening episode that was an hour and a half long, that exact amount of time passed in the story. Every time a character paused to think, or scratch, or do anything, we had to watch. Excruciating.\\n\\n\\\"Hold on, let me go get him,\\\" someone says to the cop talking on the phone. This is sort of the leitmotif of the show thus far, keeping us waiting. Does the director think this builds suspense? Watching someone waiting for his turn to be called isn't suspense: it's a lack of common sense on the part of the director because he doesn't know that he can simply jump forward without the completely tedious two minutes we sit through until the cop is called. Almost no information is told in these two minutes. The director seems to think that atmosphere and mood are all that are needed to sustain the viewers.\\n\\n\\\"I have something to tell you.\\\" \\\"OK.\\\" Waits SIX seconds to tell us.\\n\\nThe director just can't give us an establishing shot. He has to move at a speed that would never possibly break a neck. Absolutely everything is dragged on to ridiculous lengths\\n\\nSorry, Hollywood.

I use to say that about CSI or other shows that touched a little on profiling. But I love psychology. And we have seen shows that we may have liked like the profiler that we know isn't correct. It doesn't happen that way. I will say that I enjoyed it.The only other show I truly miss is Fox's The Inside. That was a good one as well but nothing like this. I have bought at least ten books on profiling that discuss different types of psychopaths,how they were created and the different psychological issues that surrounds their behavior and fantasies. How because of their bad experience during childhood and after they have learned to profile and manipulate people,the disorganized crime scene compared to organized scene and mixed crime scene and what it tells you about the unsub. Learning their geographic profile. All these things are in this show to give us a pretty reasonable idea of what they do. How they are made. Why they exist and do what they do. I find it fascinating not only to watch psychopaths and their crimes but to some extent through their fiction, learn something about them. John Douglas says he saw John Gacy and looked him right in the eye when in fact he never did so I don't really take his word about what his job was like. But many others, like Robert Ressler describe this profession in a similar way as Criminal Minds. I hope it stays on. It is the coolest. Just to clarify, I like learning why they do it. I hate what they do and how it hurts people. I don't wan't people to think I enjoy entertainment for the sake of seeing people pain or horror. I think you will enjoy this show too.

Those are the ones writing the insanely hyper-critical reviews on here. They want BCS to match it in every aspect in order for it to receive more than 5 stars on. And it's absolutely absurd. This show is it's own show. It's not a carbon copy, and whoever said it should be was dumb. It stands on its own, as it deserves to... just like BB did during its time.\\n\\nCall it slow as much as you want, but those resorting to that adjective have little depth. Any scene, any shot... and song... anything shown to the viewer in this show is layered with meaning. That is why it's a beast. If you only want blood and action, fine. Go watch something else. But if you have depth and seek a show that delivers in meaningfully depicting characters struggling to adapt to their real life (in a way all of us can relate to) then this show won't fail. It's action is scarce in comparison to the stakes BB had most of the time. But in visual storytelling and relateability, this show exceeds BB in those respects, in my humble opinion. It's Gilligan and Gould, so what else do we expect. And to consider how amazing this show is as a prequel to probably the greatest show ever made (maybe the hardest task any show could have) it's an incredible feat. \\n\\nHopefully this review will inform potential viewers on whether it's a show for them. Cause I don't believe every show is for everyone. But also hopefully clarify why so many reviews on here are skewed one way or the other. I believe most people who are emotionally attached to BB are the ones taking the time to even write a review of BCS on IMDB, because fans like me who appreciate both for what they each are feel no need to. We just enjoy it, and assume everyone else will feel the same way. But after reading the many absurd takes on Better Call Saul here... I felt something needed to be said. This isn't a simple continuation of Breaking Bad. It's its own show, and kills at what it does. Whether you enjoy visual storytelling, character development, and provocative drama filled with common meaning we all can touch, that's really up to you.

It maintains everything that makes Inspector Morse so good, while also containing enough to make it its own.\\n\\nEndeavour looks great, the series throughout is exquisitely photographed and there is something very nostalgic and charming about the atmospherically evoked 1960s period detail. It was also a genius move to keep Barrington Pheloung on board, with his hauntingly beautiful scoring and immortal Inspector Morse theme, while the classical music and operatic excerpts are delightful to hear and fit perfectly (a notable example would be in the Fugue episode, the music having a beautiful and frightfully ominous effect).\\n\\nThe series is also every bit as intelligently written as Inspector Morse, it's every bit as entertaining and also every bit as tense. Not all the story lines are very original, but they are always incredibly gripping with the mysteries not being too complicated or the identities being too improbable or obvious, Morse and Thursday's father\\/son relationship has a lot of warmth, is so well written within the stories and is a large part of the series' appeal and there is some good suspense (chilling in fact in the case of Fugue). Pacing is restrained, but that allows the atmosphere to come through, and pretty much all the same it excels in that aspect. The characters are interesting, and are evolving more and more with every episode, Morse's familiar characteristics are becoming more obvious as the writing develops and Morse and Thursday's relationship more entertaining and heartfelt.\\n\\nShaun Evans does some powerful, charismatic work as younger Morse, and is getting more and more confident with every episode, showing enough loyalty to John Thaw's iconic Morse while making the character his own too. Roger Allam is also superb, his rapport with Evans always compels and entertains but Thursday is quite a sympathetic character, as well as loyal and firm, and Allam does a lot special with a role that could have been less interesting possibly in lesser hands. All the acting is very good, as is the controlled direction, but it's the performances of Evans and Allam that will always be remembered most vividly.\\n\\nAll in all, a more than worthy (if not quite as good, only because I love Inspector Morse with a passion) prequel series and also a great series on its own that keeps getting stronger. 9\\/10 Bethany Cox\",\"NP\":[[[\"worthy\",\"JJ\"],[\"prequel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"favourite\",\"JJ\"],[\"detective\",\"JJ\"],[\"dramas\",\"NN\"]],[[\"all\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"start\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"pilot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"still-finding-its-feet-feel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"period\",\"NN\"]],[[\"detail\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"genius\",\"NN\"]],[[\"move\",\"NN\"]],[[\"board\",\"NN\"]],[[\"beautiful\",\"JJ\"],[\"scoring\",\"NN\"]],[[\"theme\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"classical\",\"JJ\"],[\"music\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"notable\",\"JJ\"],[\"example\",\"NN\"]],[[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"music\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ominous\",\"JJ\"],[\"effect\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"entertaining\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"father\\/son\",\"NN\"]],[[\"relationship\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"warmth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"large\",\"JJ\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"appeal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"suspense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fact\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"case\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"atmosphere\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"aspect\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"writing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"relationship\",\"NN\"]],[[\"heartfelt\",\"NN\"]],[[\"charismatic\",\"JJ\"],[\"work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"enough\",\"JJ\"],[\"loyalty\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"rapport\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"sympathetic\",\"JJ\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"loyal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"firm\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"acting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"controlled\",\"JJ\"],[\"direction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"worthy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"passion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"prequel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"The Wire\",\"reviewText\":\"When I watched the first two episodes I can't stand it.

Boy, did I find it. Despite taking a few episodes to really get going, Dexter unfolds superbly, bringing its many plot twists together to form a tightly woven package with highly skilled performances and excellent writing.\\n\\nThe central performance of Michael C. Hall is always riveting, as this compelling actor enables us to understand, and even sympathize with, his many predicaments. His attempts to juggle his carefully-constructed, idyllic domestic life with his code-driven nightly stalkings and executions form the central interest of this enthralling series. This is one of the great many reasons why The Sopranos was so impressive; watching Tony struggle with the demands of fulfilling his dual familial role of father and mob boss was the essence of the series, and from this, other strands were allowed to develop. Dexter also has this quality, one of many qualities, it must be added.\\n\\nThe writing, as has been mentioned, is razor-sharp. The characters are rich and alive with personality, and as the first series develops so too do the character arcs. Lieutenant LaGuerta and Dexter's sister Deborah, in particular, are well-rounded, multi-dimensional creations, and they are played to perfection by Lauren Velez and Jennifer Carpenter, respectively. There is a palpable sense of tension and excitement as the walls begin to close in on Dexter, and this reaches boiling point in Season 2. The plot is never less than intriguing, and careful and intelligent use of flashbacks allow us to gradually learn more and more about the monster(?) that is Dexter. The editing and camera-work keep a good pace to proceedings, and the lighting is always excellent, especially in the disturbing night scenes.\\n\\nThe impressive opening sequence is particularly noteworthy in its use of extreme close-ups that show a man doing seemingly normal, everyday tasks to put himself together, but if one looks beyond these mundanities a much darker picture will be revealed. The music is eerily effective here, and maintains a high level of quality throughout - always tense, and evocative of the given situation.\\n\\nSo: uniformly excellent acting, sharp dialogue, well-developed characters, intelligent plotting, creative and absorbing camera-work, and a deliciously dark humour make Dexter one of the best shows on TV right now, and further proof that the last 10 years has been the golden age for dramatic television.\",\"NP\":[[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"attempt\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"worthy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"number\",\"NN\"]],[[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"drama\",\"NN\"]],[[\"obsession\",\"NN\"]],[[\"many\",\"JJ\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"package\",\"NN\"]],[[\"excellent\",\"JJ\"],[\"writing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"central\",\"JJ\"],[\"performance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"compelling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"actor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"idyllic\",\"JJ\"],[\"domestic\",\"JJ\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"central\",\"JJ\"],[\"interest\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"struggle\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dual\",\"JJ\"],[\"familial\",\"JJ\"],[\"role\",\"NN\"]],[[\"father\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mob\",\"NN\"]],[[\"boss\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"essence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"quality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"writing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"personality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"arcs\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sister\",\"NN\"]],[[\"perfection\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"palpable\",\"JJ\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tension\",\"NN\"]],[[\"excitement\",\"NN\"]],[[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intriguing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intelligent\",\"JJ\"],[\"use\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"monster\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"editing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"camera-work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"pace\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"lighting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"disturbing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"night\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"impressive\",\"JJ\"],[\"opening\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sequence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"use\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"darker\",\"NN\"]],[[\"picture\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"music\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"high\",\"JJ\"],[\"level\",\"NN\"]],[[\"quality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"evocative\",\"NN\"]],[[\"situation\",\"NN\"]],[[\"uniformly\",\"JJ\"],[\"excellent\",\"JJ\"],[\"acting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sharp\",\"JJ\"],[\"dialogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intelligent\",\"JJ\"],[\"plotting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"camera-work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"right\",\"NN\"]],[[\"proof\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"golden\",\"JJ\"],[\"age\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dramatic\",\"JJ\"],[\"television\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Fargo\",\"reviewText\":\"Season 3 - Deep and Meaningless\",\"NP\":[[[\"Deep\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Elementary\",\"reviewText\":\"The lead actors are serious actors.

It is rare that an episode features a single murder, usually there are two or three. Given the high murder rate one would expect that the local constabulary would have a large murder unit but in fact all murders are investigated by DCI Tom Barnaby and his sergeant.\\n\\nIt is a mistake to join any club, society or organisation in the Midsomers as they are nearly all hotbeds of jealousy, rivalry and backstabbing and those that aren't will somehow offend other villagers. These feelings inevitably lead to murder, usually in a fairly imaginative way. Unusually for a TV detective Barnaby is happily married with a grown up daughter. It is surprising that wife Joyce and Daughter Cully have survived as they often found themselves in the groups where the other members were dropping like flies.\\n\\nWhile there are plenty of murders it is never overly gory so it is suitable for all but the most squeamish.

And they were eyeball deep in a mystery that had real consequences. And we got to learn about not just the \\\"gang\\\", but also their parents and some periphery characters that were rarely touched on in the comics.

Instead they come off as silly and contrived. The acting is also atrocious, which is surprising coming from solid performers like Farrell and McAdams.

This is the show where each episode reminds me of my favorite book on the subject of finding the serial killers by trying to get inside their minds and to think the way they do, and equally terrific adaptation, Red Dragon by Thomas Harris\\/Manhunter by Michael Mann. Again and again the team of the brilliant profilers, fly from their headquarters in Quantico, VA to different locations all over the country to put their minds together and complete the profile of the mysterious unsub (unknown subject) and to prevent the next strike which would be deadly. This is a very difficult, demanding and exhausting job where the lives of innocent people are at stake and every minute, even second matters. This job takes its toll from every member of the team. Often they have to make very difficult choices and more than once they face the deadly danger not only to themselves but to those who are the closest to them. \\n\\nSince I started watching the show, I am trying to catch up the seasons that I missed, so I watch the re-runs every time I have a chance getting the \\\"crash course\\\" of Criminal Minds. What amazes me that watching so many episodes in such short period of time only makes me wanting to see more. I don't recall a single mediocre episode. All of them share the intelligent writing, compelling story, inspired acting from the regular members of the cast (an elite team of FBI profilers - BAU analysts) and the guest stars. I like the music score and the choice of songs is very fitting for each occasion. I also like the famous quotes which one of the team members tells in the end of each episode, which sums up the story perfectly. More than once, I was moved deeply by the way the story was going and its resolution. What keeps me entrancing to the screen during each episode is the brain storm, the collective mind of the team putting the evidence, the small details together, analyzing them, searching for the right question to ask their super computer analyst Penelope Garcia; so she would perform her magic and come up with the one name - of the unsub who must be stopped before he attacks deadly again.\\n\\nI also noticed how masterfully the creators make the references not only to the real life famous cases but to the earlier films and books. I recognized the references to Tom Harris's Dr. Hannibal's books (the horrifying parts of \\\"Hannibal\\\" made one of the darkest and devastating two-hours episode) and films, to \\\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\\", to \\\"Natural Born Killers\\\". One memorable episode paid homage to both \\\"Psycho\\\" and \\\"Sunset Boulevard\\\". Often, the writers find the subjects for the episodes from the latest news.

They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.\\n\\nEntertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.\\n\\nIn addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.\\n\\nThe further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A.

But pondering it now, how bittersweet in its familiarity for all of us who have followed for all of these seasons, the travails and triumphs of one of the most complex dramas ever to grace television.\\n\\nLike so many fans are this very moment, I am pondering all of the time I've spent with these characters, marveling at missing the ones I loved to hate and hated to love, and how that sentiment equally applies to those still sticking around, starting first and foremost with the man affectionately known as \\\"Skip.\\\" \\n\\nJames Gandolfini has built one hell of a career for himself, while mining the many layers of the complex and conflicted Anthony Soprano. He's a man constantly at odds with the demands made on him daily by the professional and personal sides of his life. He struggles at times to make the right choices that are possible to make, but like most of us, he manages to screw up and quite often at that. And like a lot of us, he is loving and fiercely protective of both his immediate family, and the family he is part of in \\\"dis life he's chosen.\\\" But the similarities stop where most of us swear that we would do our best to kill anyone who would dare try to harm the members of our family. Tony doesn't just swear he'll do it...often he is called upon to do that very thing, (or to order someone else to take care of it), and he will do so without missing a beat.\\n\\nBut he's not without guilt, remorse, failings and all the different kinds of 'agita' that plague a major Mob boss and \\\"devoted\\\" family man. So, where's a guy like that to go when there are problems he can't even talk about with his wife or his closest confidantes? \\n\\nMeet the sexy, sultry and skilled Dr. Jennifer Melfi. For the better part of seven seasons, Lorraine Bracco has imbued this psychiatrist with a cool veneer of moxie, charm and canniness that has done wonders for a profession where it's not a secret that at times the therapists can be more effed up than their clients. Her composure has very rarely ever cracked through all of Tony's tears, taunts and tantrums, even when there has been (and at times continues to be) a sexual tension so thick you could cut it with a hacksaw. And when her emotional walls have been breached, (as with her own shrink, Dr. Elliott Kupferberg, played by an unflappable Peter Bogdonavich), the audience has been treated to some Emmy-worthy television. No surprise, then, that this show has already been so lauded a gazillion times over.\\n\\nWithout preachiness or judgment, and never soft-selling the dastardly and despicable things they do to survive in the underworld of murder, drugs, graft, gambling and prostitution, THE SOPRANOS also deals with the frailties and very human failings of these \\\"wiseguys\\\" who may be \\\"wise\\\" when it comes to the Mob, but often not in the ways that count in their lives...dealing with their loved ones or even their own huge insecurities, for all their outer toughness.\\n\\nAnd leave it to David Chase, the shrewd son-of-a-gun, to save the best revelations of characters' lives for the last. Paulie Gualtieri (Tony Sirico) discovering that his parentage was not what he thought it was, therefore leading him to question his very sense of self; caretaker Bobby 'Bacala' Baccalieri (Steven Schirripa) now having shifted his focus from the care and feeding of aging don \\\"Junior\\\" Soprano (Dominic Chianese), to his new wife and Tony's sister, Janice (Aida Turturro) and their newborn son, getting a taste of what Tony's had to go through; Tony's number one prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 Chris Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli) who is stepping it up in his beefed-up role as a captain, still trying to reconcile his place in 'the life' with his ambitions to become a screenwriter\\/producer, and the demons that haunt him in his culpability for the death of his late fianc\\u00e9e, Adriana La Cerva (Drea De Matteo).\\n\\nAnd how about Silvio Dante (amazing actor and E-Street band member Steven Van Zandt), Tony's trusted right hand and confidante, who has always been content to be a company man, now being urged to step into the spotlight by his missus (\\\"reel\\\"-and real-life wife Maureen Van Zandt)? Oh, I could just go on and on for pages and pages about the different core characters and their roles in the overall scheme (and schemING) of things, and all of the amazing guest stars who have added such considerable gravitas and grit to the mix (including Joe Pantoliano, frequent guest director Steve Buscemi, Tim Daly, Robert Patrick, Anabella Sciorra, Paul Mazursky, Ron Leibman, Frankie Valli and most recently Hal Holbrook).\\n\\nThere are people of narrow vision who claim that THE SOPRANOS has no value or merit whatsoever; that all it does is glorify the violent and amoral lifestyle of its renegade characters. I'd be willing to wager my next paycheck that the majority of these people have never seen a full episode, let alone part of one...That to them, what's on the surface is cut-and-dried. Sad that they'll never realize that this is simply about mobsters the way SIX FEET UNDER was only about a funeral home, or that DEADWOOD was nothing more than a dirty tale about lawlessness in the Old West.\\n\\nThanks to Mr. Chase and every single person who had anything to do with helping to provide us with a such a rarified glimpse into how the world that we first encountered through the efforts of Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, has changed in our times today...\\n\\nAnd for letting us do it from a safe distance, in the comfort of our living rooms.\\n\\nAs for the chance of an hour of

The only criticism of the show would be Laura Prepon.

The film is helmed and penned by David Milch. During the series 3 season run it acquired an enormous fanbase but the show left fans hanging like a dead man on the end of the proverbial rope. Milch created a bravura American Western series. He also penned several of the episodes. The series has outstanding direction, writing, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. The series includes an all star cast with artists such as Hawkes, Boothe, McRaney, Dillahunt, Dickens, Gunn, Parker, Welliver, Callie and Weigert to name a few. All of the cast including the supporting cast deliver superlative performances. Olyphant and McShane command the series. Some of the characters in the series are fictionalized and some were real life residents. Milch referenced actual diaries and newspapers for the development of characters, events and the visual setting of the series. The series is set in 1870's South Dakota in a town called Deadwood. Deadwood starts as a post civil war camp that has yet to be appropriated by any U.S. state. Due to this fact the town was lawless except for Seth Bullock, a real life resident, who is a character that is a mining supply store owner and appointed sheriff. The town starts off as a camp, but due to a massive gold strike it turns into a mining town which attracts an array of characters mostly looking to get rich and others looking for control of the town due to the lawlessness. Initially it is Al Swearengen, another real life resident, who rules the town and owns the Gem Theater which is a notorious brothel. He does have a nemesis in Cy Tolliver who owns the Bella Union Saloon, but the two seem to tolerate each other as long as they don't interfere in each other's goals and aren't trying to subterfuge each other. Once word spreads of the mining George Hearst, who was a real life renowned businessman, miner and politician, arrives with his henchman to take control and capitalize on the fortune nearby. He had already established several mining operations and Deadwood is his next target. The series follows the politics involved in Deadwood before and after it's seizure by the Dakota Territory. During the series we are introduced to characters such as Martha Bullock who is Seth's wife; Alma Garret who is a NY socialite that purchases a stake in the territory; Joanie Stubbs who is Cy's former madam and after splitting from him runs her own brothel; Doc Cochran who is the only physician in town; Sol Star who opens up a mining supply store with Bullock and Silas Adams who is an emissary for the government to name just a few. The series also introduces real life western characters such as Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Wyatt Earp, Charlie Utter and E.B. Farnum. There are several different plot lines within the series involving all of the characters. The series is gritty, violent, duplicitous, callous, exorcising, elaborate, intelligent, substantial, ingenious, cathartic and has an ambiguous ending hence the upcoming film. This series is a stunning examination of the old west with themes such as the law versus the lawless, politics and the haves and have nots.

I've noticed that in Punisher, Star Trek Discovery and now here. Everybody is just leading endless idle conversations about nothing with nothing really happening. This season of TD really deserves TD. The whole season, all eight episodes could fit into an average yawning 100 minute movie.

Excellent actors and performances of nothing. All idling. Talks, thoughts, more talks, slow pace, them slower pace and some talks and thoughts. In slow pace.

Not only is it one of the most fun films of the year, but it's so much different than the action films we have today. It doesn't try to be inventive or over-the-top, it just plays to it's strengths.\\n\\nI have never been a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. Even in The Matrix, which is a great film, his acting falls pretty flat to me. He hasn't showed me anything that can make him a true thespian on screen. But as John Wick, he's perfect. The role doesn't call for anything more than just being a likable bada**. Wick is a man dealing with the death of his wife and retirement of his past associations with assassins of sort. He finally feels like he get's closure with his wife and then it's all ripped away from him by the very gangsters he was once affiliated with. He goes on an absolute killing rampage. To say the body count adds up is an understatement. Wick goes to great lengths to find the people who took everything from him, but it's not exactly easy for him. Being someone who just came out of retirement means you may be a little rusty, well Wick is definitely that. That's one of the many things I appreciated about this film. It never seemed like he was blowing through these guys without danger. Sure he effortlessly kills plenty, but he also struggles with a few as well.\\n\\nKilling a cute little dog would tick off anyone, so I don't blame the character for being mad, but I'm not sure there needed to be this many deaths. There are plenty of innocent security guards who die at the hands of Wick. At times, it just felt like a little too much for a revenge film. But I really loved all of John's interactions with people from his past. They all seem to be as surprised that Wick is killing again, as we are that this film turned out to be good. I thought it was a nice touch that the police officer simply let the fact that there were a bunch of dead people in Wick's apartment, go. Alfie Allen plays the main villain, and it seemed as though his storyline is very similar to that of Game of Thrones. He's constantly under-appreciated and so he wants to prove himself, but ends up doing something terribly stupid. It was also nice to see Bridget Regan from Agent Carter briefly pop up.\\n\\nBut besides the fact that the script was pretty weak and the body count was pretty high, the film is just awesome. The 'Drive' sounding music and score to go along with the breathtaking action sequences made for one helluva ride. Keanu Reeves should stick to these less demanding and fun action roles.

Suffice to say that the two main characters are two Baltimore city detectives. Jimmy McNulty (played by Dominic West) is a white Irish rebellious detective who will screw anyone to get to the criminal he is chasing. Along the way he hurts a lot of his fellow cops, his bosses and lets down his immediate family time and time again. With all his faults though once he gives you that great Irish grin of his all is forgiven, no matter what the circumstances.\\n\\nMcNulty's partner is Detective William Moreland, better known around the station house and the bars simply as \\\"Bunk\\\" who knows McNulty best. Bunk is a heavy set well dressed black cop (played by Wendell Pierce) who likes to chomp on a cigar and drink hard liquor to extremes. Bunk has a lot of life in him, and is considered a cops impression of what a real detective should be. A hard drinking, womanizing, persistent cop who really wants to get the worst criminal elements behind bars serving hard time. \\n\\nBoth Bunk and McNulty have ex-wives and two children but their lives really evolve around the city of Baltimore's urban city corners where drugs are always readily available, and murders are popping up within the walls behind condemned row houses by the dozens. The other two characters who deserve special mention are the drug lords, Avon Barksdale (played by Wood Harris) and Russell \\\"Stringer\\\" Bell (played by Idris Elba). Now these two gangsta's grew up on the city streets of Baltimore like many other city hoods but the difference is they had both street smarts and the will to kill anyone who got in their way. Theirs are interesting story lines throughout the series and keep the audience guessing what they will do next. No spoiler alert so I will defer from giving away too much on their path to destruction.\\n\\nTwo characters who you can't help but feel compassion for due to their diverse journeys throughout the series are the drug addicted junk man Reginald \\\"Bubbles\\\" Cousins played to perfection by Andre Royo, and the shotgun wielding gay drug thief Omar Little, also played with fearless perfection by Michael Kenneth Williams. Now their lives when involved in any scene are never predictable and you cannot help but root for them to win. Hell, even the cops cut them a lot of slack as they can see that their hearts are big, but their minds are twisted after living on the streets their entire lives.\\n\\nI could go on and provide details on at least another dozen strong performances by other cops, attorneys, judges, police captains, shipyard workers, and even kids, but I suggest instead that you keep this crime themed television series on your \\\"must watch\\\" list and if you ever want to see a series that captivates the drug crime world of a major urban city such as in this Baltimore story you won't be able to stop watching until you watch at least a couple more episodes before you go to bed far too late in to the early morning hours because it is just that good a dramatic crime series. And isn't that really when the crime comes out? Late at night?\\n\\nI give it a perfect 10 out of 10 and a MUST SEE for a television crime and dramatic series.\",\"NP\":[[[\"wife\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"complete\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gift\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"decade\",\"NN\"]],[[\"relevancy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"human\",\"JJ\"],[\"nature\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"past\",\"JJ\"],[\"decade\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"total\",\"NN\"]],[[\"excellent\",\"JJ\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Suffice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"city\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"white\",\"JJ\"],[\"Irish\",\"JJ\"],[\"rebellious\",\"JJ\"],[\"detective\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"criminal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"immediate\",\"JJ\"],[\"family\",\"NN\"]],[[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"Irish\",\"JJ\"],[\"grin\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"matter\",\"NN\"]],[[\"partner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"station\",\"NN\"]],[[\"house\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"heavy\",\"JJ\"],[\"set\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dressed\",\"JJ\"],[\"black\",\"JJ\"],[\"cop\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"cigar\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hard\",\"JJ\"],[\"liquor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"cops\",\"JJ\"],[\"impression\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"real\",\"JJ\"],[\"detective\",\"NN\"]],[[\"A\",\"DT\"],[\"hard\",\"JJ\"],[\"drinking\",\"NN\"]],[[\"persistent\",\"JJ\"],[\"cop\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hard\",\"JJ\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"city\",\"NN\"]],[[\"urban\",\"JJ\"],[\"city\",\"NN\"]],[[\"condemned\",\"JJ\"],[\"row\",\"NN\"]],[[\"special\",\"JJ\"],[\"mention\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"drug\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gangsta\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"city\",\"NN\"]],[[\"many\",\"JJ\"],[\"other\",\"JJ\"],[\"city\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"difference\",\"NN\"]],[[\"both\",\"DT\"],[\"street\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"No\",\"DT\"],[\"spoiler\",\"NN\"]],[[\"path\",\"NN\"]],[[\"destruction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"compassion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"diverse\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"drug\",\"NN\"]],[[\"junk\",\"NN\"]],[[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"perfection\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"shotgun\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gay\",\"JJ\"],[\"drug\",\"NN\"]],[[\"thief\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fearless\",\"JJ\"],[\"perfection\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"slack\",\"NN\"]],[[\"another\",\"DT\"],[\"dozen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"police\",\"NN\"]],[[\"shipyard\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"list\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"drug\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"major\",\"JJ\"],[\"urban\",\"JJ\"],[\"city\",\"NN\"]],[[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"watching\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"couple\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"early\",\"JJ\"],[\"morning\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"dramatic\",\"JJ\"],[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"night\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dramatic\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Gotham\",\"reviewText\":\"A show set in the Batman universe.. except without Batman? A lot of people didn't like this concept but i was one of the people who did. I wanted to see the villains' rise to power most of all.. but how would they be interesting with no Batman to counter them? Well that's where the early years of Jim Gordon come into play. The show follows Jim as he cracks strange cases whilst trying to help a young Bruce Wayne solve the mystery of his parents' murder. It seemed each week for a while we would see a new villain come in and act like they run Gotham City before Jim and Harvey Bullock shut them down, but it turned into more than that.\\n\\nAfter a while the show did start to feel repetitive and i wanted to see more focus on a single villain that on a bunch and we ended up getting that by the end and i absolutely loved the finale, but before we talk about that let's talk about what i liked less. Over the course of the series we were introduced and hinted at early incarnations of villains we could expect to see. Scarecrow, Poison Ivy and even The Joker have been hinted at and whilst these are some of the best Batman villains i feel that they should have been left for later series' and that this series should have focused on three particular villains who i will talk about later. The biggest gripe for me was hinting at Jerome being the Joker.. Joker is obviously a big deal in the Batman universe and i feel without Batman being introduced then Joker should be left well alone, but also early hints to Bruce being Batman felt shoehorned in, i feel less focus should be drawn to him and the Batman references as well as the awful cat puns from Selina Kyle should have been toned down a huge deal.\\n\\nHowever, i do feel Gotham is a very entertaining show to say the least. It is ridiculous and some of the characters act even more cartoony than they do on Batman: The Animated Series which is saying a lot. This isn't so much a bad thing because the show knows how ridiculous it is whilst still maintaining a gritty feel to it and i give it props for that. The acting is over the top but Ben McKenzie as Jim Gordon and Donal Logue as Harvey Bullock are absolutely true to the characters (especially Logue) and play well off each other. The villains i mentioned are Fish Mooney, a new character who isn't in the comics played by Jada Pinkett Smith who brings a stylish yet creepy edge to her character, she was one of the best on the show. I also loved Cory Michael Smith as Edward Nygma, his slow descent into becoming the Riddler was at times shoehorned in but when it worked it was incredible, especially in the finale. The absolute stand out of the show however is of course Robin Lord Taylor who plays Oswald Cobblepot\\/Penguin. My god, he gave one of the best performances i have seen in TV for years, he made me root for the Penguin's survival and the Penguin has always been low down on my list of favourite Batman villains (that is until now). If anyone can be praised for single handedly making this show work and bringing a whole heap of crazy, ridiculous yet incredible acting skills to the table it is Robin Lord Taylor who honestly deserves a lot more work. He has clearly earned it.\\n\\nSo no, Gotham does not go without its flaws and characters such as Edward Nygma should have got more screen time if they were to be introduced now to let their characters develop but i expect series 2 will open a new set of opportunities for them which i look forward to. If Jerome truly is the Joker though i'm not sure how i would feel. The finale, without spoilers, was very satisfying to me. Some of it felt maybe too ridiculous such as the scenes with Dr. Lee and Barbara but overall i was entertained and am intrigued to see more so that is always a good sign. A fun show that doesn't take itself too seriously. It doesn't quite scale a show like Daredevil but it doesn't exactly try to and it also gives us one of the best characters in recent TV with Penguin.\\n\\n8.5\\/10\",\"NP\":[[[\"A\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"A\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"concept\",\"NN\"]],[[\"i\",\"NN\"]],[[\"rise\",\"NN\"]],[[\"power\",\"NN\"]],[[\"all..\",\"NN\"]],[[\"play\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"mystery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"murder\",\"NN\"]],[[\"each\",\"DT\"],[\"week\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"while\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"new\",\"JJ\"],[\"villain\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"focus\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"single\",\"JJ\"],[\"villain\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bunch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"i\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"finale\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"let\",\"NN\"]],[[\"talk\",\"NN\"]],[[\"i\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"course\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Batman\",\"NN\"]],[[\"later\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gripe\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"big\",\"JJ\"],[\"deal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"universe\",\"NN\"]],[[\"i\",\"NN\"]],[[\"focus\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"awful\",\"JJ\"],[\"cat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"huge\",\"JJ\"],[\"deal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"entertaining\",\"JJ\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cartoony\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bad\",\"JJ\"],[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"gritty\",\"JJ\"],[\"feel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"acting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"new\",\"JJ\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"edge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"slow\",\"JJ\"],[\"descent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"finale\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"absolute\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"course\",\"NN\"]],[[\"god\",\"NN\"]],[[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"root\",\"NN\"]],[[\"survival\",\"NN\"]],[[\"list\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"whole\",\"JJ\"],[\"heap\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crazy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"table\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"screen\",\"JJ\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"new\",\"JJ\"],[\"set\",\"NN\"]],[[\"truly\",\"NN\"]],[[\"i\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"finale\",\"NN\"]],[[\"overall\",\"JJ\"],[\"i\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"sign\",\"NN\"]],[[\"A\",\"DT\"],[\"fun\",\"NN\"]],[[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"recent\",\"JJ\"],[\"TV\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Dexter\",\"reviewText\":\"What a series, great series, July arrived and we all sat down to watch season 8.\\n\\nAt the beginning of season 8 I was hopeful, mixed emotions for characters such as Zach Hamilton and Evelyn Vogel, but overall I was enjoying it, then this finale was scheduled, so I watched it.\\n\\nFirst of all I would like to say sorry to the people who have watched and waited for every single Dexter episode and season, as in they watched the first ever episode on its release date.

For someone who is so smart, she is so dump. I don't know this, and I don't know that. Sure it work the first few times, but can't she learn? She kept saying I know I'm social inept and I'm trying to be better, and yet she fail to learn without people spell thing out for her. And why does she has to act like a B to people who she seem lesser intelligent. Being unsympathetic after a while is just irritating, irrational and is plain dump. Seeing her dialog with booth trying to explain social norm to her make you feel like you should hit your head against the wall, pass out so you don't have to suffer this bad series. And what's worse, after 10mins of irritating you with her social inept and refuse to understand other way of thinking, you are being slapped with at least 10mins of her failing to do the normal social thing, + another 10 of apologies for failing to do so, + 10mins of cheesy you get it next time. Just that she doesn't, and the viscous circle repeat. Every episode, she mocks at human being, then she glare or hate you because you laugh at her failure to act accordingly, and she feels no pity for you when she nuke you down with her harsh words. I found her character is such a child, and it irritating, and that child didn't learn, didn't grow up, and that make it hard to shallow. And lot of times, her character changes her personality like 180 degree so quick, that you feel not genuine. Like she dish on your behavior to the ground with her whiny monotone for a good 3mins+, then within 30s, she came and join you and act like it was really fun -.- The plot line is boring, and a few episodes are rip off of other show, without the good bit of it.

Is it it's characters, is it ability to create fantastic choreography or maybe new, shiny special effects. Is it sound design or perhaps a good story ? What will elevate action movie to a new heights? What you need to do to create an instant classic? John Wick 3 creators might not have found all the answers but they definitely created something special and unique.\\n\\nJohn Wick Parabellum is a direct continuation to the previous movie. It picks up just after 2nd movie finishes, just when John Wick is about to be made excommunicado. The first 20 minutes of the movie are really special and I enjoyed it immensely. John Wick needs to escape from the never ending wave after wave of assassins who try to collect very large bounty put on his head. In a city filled with assassins controlled by secretive yet very powerful and feared organization this is not an easy task. Assassins are everywhere here, on every corner of every street, which actually begs a question. Are there are any normal people left in the world?\\n\\nThe stunts from the start to finish were really special, some of them really unique and brutal. People were gasping in the cinema, me including. The sheer unfiltered violence and constant fight for survival, this movie does this well. There was even a fantastic sequence featuring German shepherds, the scene with the dogs added more excitement to brutal showcase of John Wick's and Halle Berry's gun skills. It felt like a continues shot, maybe even it was. When camera was rolling and following dogs attacking army of villains, this was very fluid and kept me on my toes from start to finish. Let me tell you this again, this movie does this sort of action really, really well.\\n\\nWhere it falls short is the actual story. There was an opportunity here to do more with the story, unfortunately it took a backstage here or maybe even left the fast moving Wick's car and stayed on the side lines as what we got here is a predictable plot with predictable twists and really not that interesting main character. Even Polar has better story than JW. John's motives are confused here, his choices do not make much sense and his strategic thinking leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\nIt does not work for John's benefit, it makes him rather not so special - a flat and shallow character, apart of amazing survivability skills he has nothing else to offer. Is he really just a blunt weapon, tip of the spear, instrument of destruction. What is the whole point of this destructive adventure? We have here this faceless organization, their cruel motives and ways, their world dominance. Movie fails to explain this to us more. The story and subsequently the movie is lacking depth !\\n\\nRemember that this is a pure action movie, however special it is, misses this final piece of the puzzle in its attempt of becoming instant classic and is sadly just punching above waist, becoming average movie which will definitely entertain you but will leave you begging for answer and more, more sense and more emotions.

They introduce the audience to the characters in a way that doesn't come across as them trying to bluntly introduce us, as so many shows clumsy do; Shows that tell us how close two friends are in a way real people don't talk, by having one of them tell the other, \\\"I know you said you didn't want to hang out Friday but I'm your best friend and we're going to hang out.\\\" Brooklyn 9-9 accomplishes these crucial initial first impressions by not overstating the core personalities of the characters. Half way in, we quickly begin to experience the precincts average day and learn of the quirky interactions that occur between characters alongside the new C.O., Capt. Holt(Andre Braugher).

While, for the first half of the movie, it's hard to grasp the exact tone of it, the second half has established a rather sad, uncompromising atmosphere - in a very good way. The pacing is not slow, it's quite engaging and has a smooth flow, at least for drama standards. As for the cinematography - it's crafty & careful, camera work and editing is swift and dynamic. While all is good and decent, the main quality of the movie is the acting - I was surprised by Zac Efron, whom I hadn't really seen in a serious role before. Job well done, Zac, job well done. The supporting cast is also remarkably great & John Malkovich is playing John Malkovich as always.

Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.\\n\\nThis is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel. \\n\\nThen in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer. \\n\\nOkay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).\\n\\nYou can tell from the word 'go' that writer\\/producer\\/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer\\/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to \\\"ask nicely.\\\"\\n\\nWhich brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)\\n\\nA caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been \\\"edited for time and content\\\" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.\\n\\nAnd after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys.

The surprisingly gay new police chief is a riot for how he takes his zany team in stride, breaking character to enjoy their antics, while maintaining a strict iron-faced facade. Rosa, in particular, stands out as 'scary cop' - Stephanie Beatriz will be a breakout star with this role - you can't get enough of her...and if she and Clumsy Mousy Charles get together or even just continue to dance around it, they'll be the best, most hilarious parody of a Will They\\/Won't They ever! \\n\\nThe producers claim to be channeling Barney Miller - a far-fetched chutzpadik claim for people who did NOT produce THAT 70s Show, because rarely have current television producers captured that classic 70s overt brand of comedy, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine has indeed!

I normally don't do reviews, however with this show heading into it's 9th season, proper criticism is long overdue. Crime procedurals is not a TV genre I'm a fan of and generally avoid them. However I started watching this show after seeing the short lived series Higher Ground and thinking AJ Cook really had potential. After seeing all her later movies, this show was all that's left so I started watching it and hoped it wasn't too bad. I set my standards too high.\\n\\nSaying this show is unoriginal is an understatement. I don't think there's a single thing about this show that wasn't taken from somewhere else. Heck the creators admits to taking ideas off real life cases. First off the characters. They are cardboard stock characters from other crime procedurals. Some of them are blatant ripoffs when I hear more about other crime procedurals like NCIS and Numbers. You got the old wise mentor, the apathetic boss, the tough guy, the socially awkward genius, the woman who can hang with the boys, the token eye candy, and stolen from NCIS, the computer expert who's suppose to be wild and funny. If they don't sound clich\\u00e9 enough, their distinction is maximized. For example the apathetic boss is so devoid of personality that the actor didn't felt necessary to give him any facial expressions. The tough guy is always the one tackling people. The socially awkward genius has a social past so pathetic Steve Urkel and the geeks from Big Bang Theory come off as more realistic people. The token eye candy (AJ's character) is basically a glorified extra who barely does anything. Their wardrobe never changes either just in case it's not blatant enough what type of characters these are. Boss is always wearing a suit, tough guy is dressed up like he's running a military obstacle course, genius looks like he works in a cubicle, the female agents are dressed up like GQ models and the \\\"funny\\\" computer whiz has over the top hair, layers of makeup and an outfit that overall makes her look like some sort runaway from the circus.\\n\\nAs for the story, what story? It takes ques from CSI and every other popular CBS crime show of having that overproduced Michael Bay inspired look as well as grotesque and shocking images and ideas. CSI started this with their forensics and dead bodies while Criminal Minds seems to be aiming for as close to Saw levels. Cause you know, Michael Bay and Saw is what people like to flock to. Episodes themselves are completely by the books. Opening scene will be about the case in question. We hit credits then someone on the team will cite some historical figure at the beginning and end of every episode. This idea apparently was stolen from another crime show. Team presents the case so the audience can follow what's going on. Killer is almost always a guy, victims is almost always women, local authority is almost always incompetent morons. Team will try and piece things together while the killer is doing something that escalates the matters. This is how episodes constantly keeps you on edge. They will also play overly dramatic music to let the audience know how they should be feeling cause things aren't blatant enough already and this show likes to treat it's audience like morons. Though if people actually think this show has great writing then I guess the creators aren't wrong there. The team figures it at the end then gives a exposition dump, if they haven't already, to the audience, uh, I mean authorities like they're reading off a script. Okay they are actually reading off a script, but you're not suppose to make it look like they are. They always make it in the last moment with tough guy tackling the killer. Case has been solved in the course of a day or two. The End.\\n\\nThis is all then repeated in a infinite loop until this show gets cancelled. Everything this show specializes is pretty much everything I hate about the crime procedural genre. There's no story or character development at all. The most you get is if something is happening to the actors in real life (like they're leaving the series) and the writers are forced to accommodate to the change. Speaking of change, the cast has been changed a number of times and the new actor generally looks like the last actor. How original. Well to be fair, they did try the bold move of replacing AJ's token eye candy with Rebecca Locke from the series the Inside. I'm not kidding, it's Rebecca Locke with Rachel Nichols playing her also, except she has CM's craptastic writing behind her. Most of what you know about the characters are given in throwaway lines that never gets followed up on. Not that it matters, whenever they do try and develop these \\\"characters\\\", it's always cringe worthy. If the writers just happens to be planning (read: not a reaction to real life) to bring in a character that gets close to a main cast, they are sure to die just for more shock value and things reset back to status quo: the way the writers like it. It's apparent shock value is the only writing skills the staff has. There's not even any concept episodes shows like these like to try out once and a while. You know the episodes that's completely different from the usually. I'm utterly convinced the writers of this series does not have a creative bone in their bodies.\\n\\nI cannot wait for the day this series gets cancelled cause good riddance and hopefully I can enjoy AJ Cook in something

Thinking about it more today I realized other than a couple of brief ones from the end and beginning of the movie I don't really remember anything. I know the mark of a good movie is not always that you remember it forever and you think about it all the time but it is kind of important to make it impactful. This movie is based on a mostly true story so I understand that they had to base it in reality but I think something that might have added a bit more flavor would be a bit more action. This doesn't have to be car chases but the movie sets up these problems for Robert Redfords character Forrest Tucker and then the forget about a lot of them.\\n\\nWhat I liked about the movie was first the acting, I have always been a fan of Robert Redford but in this movie he is like a smooth glass of whiskey. He has so much charm and knowns the role he is playing so well that you when he smiles you can't help but smile with him. Sissy Spacek, and Cassy Affleck both turn in damn fine performances, I think Casey Affleck is almost playing himself in this movie and looks realistically tired and somber for someone who doesn't like his job. Danny Glover and Tom Waits are Redfords partners in crime and they do a very good job also but each have about 14 minutes of screen time so I would have liked to have seen them more. Also the director David Lowery does a pretty good job at making you feel the time and place, not I a super obvious way like a bunch of news headlines put together explaining the big events of that year but in a quite way. The movies goes down pretty smooth there's some action but it slow and not the main point of the movie. The end of this movie without spoiling it is very enjoyable.\\n\\nWhat I didn't like: now I've seen slow movies before but this movie adds slow to a soft piano score and Redfords smooth as butter voice and you get a put you to sleep movie. I had a hard time staying awake watching it and that is a bit because it is around 20 minutes to long. The story starts very slow in the beginning and at the end it races through around 10 years and then ends. That's kind of strange. Also the soundtrack is unremarkable or not present at best and extremely uneven and boarding at worst.

But it has fallen so low, riddled with the writers' own personal manias, and Steven Moffat's decision to twist his narratives (no longer 'stories' in the conventional sense), to redesign Holmes as a troubled and alienated super-hero wandering aimlessly through visual gimmickry and spectacular effects. The third episode of Season 3 is especially appalling. The moment towards the end when Sherlock shouts \\\"I am not a hero, I am a functioning sociopath!\\\" was so painful, I still can't get it out of my head. That moment surely has nothing to do with the character of Sherlock Holmes, the all-too-human hero (which he most certainly was) created by Conan Doyle, but it defines how Moffat and his team understand *their* character, 'Sherlock,' and perhaps how they understand their audience as well. Given the popularity of this show, apparently many young people do not want exceptional humans capable of resolving difficult problems, they want sick people with friends in high places who can thrash the arrogant and get away with it.\\n\\nThere will certainly be a Season 4, and we can easily predict that it will be on a grand scale visually, and utterly impoverished of any good ideas or decent story telling. Moffat is no longer interested in storytelling, he wants to build a post-modern mythology much we are seeing in the Marvel Comics films.\\n\\nBut Conan Doyle didn't write for comic books (or myth), he assumed an audience of literate, reasoning adults; and the best of the films based on his stories have always assumed the same audience, and delivered proper variants of some of the best stories written in the English language. It's too bad Moffat has chosen a different course. \\n\\nNote: There are currently four series of films attempting to revise the canon of Conan Doyle's brilliant Victorian detective for the 21st Century. One from the UK (Sherlock, for TV), one from the US (Elementary, for TV), one from Russia (Sherlock Homes, for TV), and the internationally produced films of Guy Ritchie, starring Robert Downey. Notably, each involves a radical re-envisioning of the character and his place in the world. We may have reached a point in history when filmmakers simply cannot give us the Great Detective as he was imagined by Doyle and played (with variations) throughout the 20th Century. Rating the 4 series: Sherlock Holmes (Russia): 9 of 10, with strong stories and a believably proletarian nerd Holmes. Sherlock (UK): 6 of 10; excellent first season has been betrayed by Steven Moffat's flashy showmanship until the stories are incoherent now (Season 3), the characters no longer likable, the focus almost completely lost. Elementary (US): 4 of 10; the redefined Holmes, a nervous, unsympathetic recovering drug addict, is not without interest, and any show with Lucy Liu in it gets the benefit of her quiet but charismatic presence and talent. But basically, this is just a routine American police procedural with a gimmick. I doubt that Hollywood can do anything else. Sherlock Holmes (Ritchie\\/Downey): 1 of 10. This series lacks any coherence in its stories or continuity. It's just a series of set-pieces with running around, fist fights, explosions, and campy jokes.\",\"NP\":[[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"beginning\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brilliant\",\"JJ\"],[\"modern\",\"JJ\"],[\"detective\",\"NN\"]],[[\"loyal\",\"JJ\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"era\",\"NN\"]],[[\"high\",\"JJ\"],[\"technology\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"personal\",\"JJ\"],[\"manias\",\"NN\"]],[[\"decision\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"conventional\",\"JJ\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"super-hero\",\"NN\"]],[[\"wandering\",\"NN\"]],[[\"visual\",\"JJ\"],[\"gimmickry\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"third\",\"JJ\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"moment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"hero\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"functioning\",\"JJ\"],[\"sociopath\",\"NN\"]],[[\"head\",\"NN\"]],[[\"That\",\"DT\"],[\"moment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nothing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"all-too-human\",\"JJ\"],[\"hero\",\"NN\"]],[[\"team\",\"NN\"]],[[\"understand\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"popularity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"grand\",\"JJ\"],[\"scale\",\"NN\"]],[[\"decent\",\"JJ\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"telling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"post-modern\",\"JJ\"],[\"mythology\",\"NN\"]],[[\"myth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"literate\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"English\",\"JJ\"],[\"language\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"different\",\"JJ\"],[\"course\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Note\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"canon\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brilliant\",\"JJ\"],[\"Victorian\",\"JJ\"],[\"detective\",\"NN\"]],[[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"TV\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"radical\",\"JJ\"],[\"re-envisioning\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"place\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"history\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"proletarian\",\"JJ\"],[\"nerd\",\"NN\"]],[[\"excellent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"flashy\",\"JJ\"],[\"showmanship\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"focus\",\"NN\"]],[[\"drug\",\"NN\"]],[[\"addict\",\"NN\"]],[[\"interest\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"benefit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"charismatic\",\"JJ\"],[\"presence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"talent\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"gimmick\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"coherence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"continuity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile\",\"reviewText\":\"Not what I expected\",\"NP\":[]},{\"title\":\"Better Call Saul\",\"reviewText\":\"(Updated after Season 4).\\n\\nIntroducing Jimmy McGill (played by Bob Odenkirk). You may know him better as Saul Goodman, Walter White's slippery, resourceful lawyer in Breaking Bad. When first we meet him it is a few years before he meets Walter White. He is a struggling lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He mostly defends small-time crooks and represents people in civil liability claims (much of which amounts to nothing more than ambulance chasing). His brother, Charles \\\"Chuck\\\" McGill (Michael McKean), is a senior partner at a prestigious Albuquerque law firm but hasn't left his house for several months due to a strange affliction. Jimmy is supporting him through bringing him groceries and the like. Jimmy has a dark, pre-lawyer past, being a small-time fraudster in Chicago before moving to Albuquerque to start over and work with at his brother's firm. We also meet Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), ex-cop now working as a toll booth attendant at the courthouse parking lot. We see how Jimmy and Mike's stories converge and how Jimmy slowly becomes the Saul Goodman we know from Breaking Bad.\\n\\nGood drama series: engaging with some interesting episode-specific stories and solid season\\/series-wide stories. Great character depth - we see how Jimmy got to where he is and what makes him tick. Decent depth to secondary characters too.\\n\\nNot as compelling a watch as Breaking Bad though, especially during Season 1. Part of the problem is you know how Jimmy\\/Saul is going to end up, and you want him to get there as soon as possible. Saul Goodman was a wonderfully colourful character in Breaking Bad - funny, very resourceful and not above underhanded means to achieve ends. Jimmy McGill (in Season 1, at least) isn't even a shadow of Saul Goodman. So the longer the Jimmy part is drawn out and the Saul part delayed, the more impatient you get.\\n\\nIn Season 2 this is far less of an issue, as the sub-plots are good enough to stand on their own, without even knowing that Breaking Bad even exists.\\n\\nOnly other negative is that I find the character of Chuck quite irritating and always tend to feel anything involving him is a sideshow and a distraction from the main events. This is not the case in Season 3 though...\\n\\nSeason 3 is where it all starts to come together. Jimmy uses the name Saul Goodman for the first time and things with Chuck reach a breaking point, the fall-out from which pushes the series in a different, more interesting direction. On Mike's front, a face familiar to Breaking Bad viewers appears and makes a profound impact. This additional link with Breaking Bad helps to make you think the two stories are at last converging.\\n\\nSeason 4 is the best season to date. The Breaking Bad storyline is definitely in view, with more characters from that series appearing...and a memorable structure. More a crime drama than a domestic drama, at last.\\n\\nSeason 1 - 8\\/10, S2 - 9\\/10, S3 - 9\\/10, S4 - 10\\/10\",\"NP\":[[[\"slippery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"resourceful\",\"JJ\"],[\"lawyer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"lawyer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"civil\",\"JJ\"],[\"liability\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nothing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ambulance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"chasing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brother\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"senior\",\"JJ\"],[\"partner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"law\",\"NN\"]],[[\"firm\",\"NN\"]],[[\"house\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"strange\",\"JJ\"],[\"affliction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"dark\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pre-lawyer\",\"JJ\"],[\"past\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"small-time\",\"JJ\"],[\"fraudster\",\"NN\"]],[[\"work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brother\",\"NN\"]],[[\"firm\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"toll\",\"NN\"]],[[\"booth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"attendant\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"courthouse\",\"NN\"]],[[\"parking\",\"NN\"]],[[\"lot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"converge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Good\",\"JJ\"],[\"drama\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"engaging\",\"NN\"]],[[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"depth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"depth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"watch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"problem\",\"NN\"]],[[\"colourful\",\"JJ\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"funny\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"shadow\",\"NN\"]],[[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"delayed\",\"NN\"]],[[\"impatient\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"issue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"sideshow\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"distraction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"case\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"name\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"breaking\",\"NN\"]],[[\"point\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"fall-out\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"interesting\",\"JJ\"],[\"direction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"front\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"face\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"profound\",\"JJ\"],[\"impact\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"additional\",\"JJ\"],[\"link\",\"NN\"]],[[\"last\",\"JJ\"],[\"converging\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"date\",\"NN\"]],[[\"storyline\",\"NN\"]],[[\"view\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"memorable\",\"JJ\"],[\"structure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"drama\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"domestic\",\"JJ\"],[\"drama\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Endeavour\",\"reviewText\":\"After seeing the first few episodes of second series, Endeavour ranks as one of the best contemporary period police procedurals.

Perhaps this is meant to be tongue in cheek, as most things are in this show, because in one episode an obviously deranged killer says religion is a mental disease. Whether that's meant to be ironic or not, be prepared for some derision of all things spiritual.\\n\\nOverall, this show will make you want to pack your bags and visit beautiful England, just watch your back and never answer the door with \\\"oh, it's you.\\\"\",\"NP\":[[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"full\",\"JJ\"],[\"moon\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"one\",\"NN\"]],[[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"strange\",\"JJ\"],[\"motive\",\"NN\"]],[[\"watch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"another\",\"DT\"],[\"one\",\"NN\"]],[[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"charm\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sit\",\"JJ\"],[\"back\",\"NN\"]],[[\"relax\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"prism\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"scenery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"favorite\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"subtle\",\"JJ\"],[\"humor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"family\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sinister\",\"NN\"]],[[\"spooky\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bump\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"night\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"each\",\"DT\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"trip\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"store\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"reason\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"family\",\"NN\"]],[[\"viewing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"obscenity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"minimum\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"word\",\"NN\"]],[[\"monogamy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"next\",\"JJ\"],[\"door\",\"NN\"]],[[\"neighbor\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"tongue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cheek\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"killer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"religion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"mental\",\"JJ\"],[\"disease\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"derision\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"visit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"back\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"door\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"The Good Fight\",\"reviewText\":\"There was something missing in my life and when this show came out I knew what it was...the good wife...after years of being so loyal to the show i was so let down when it ended...(and I have to point out it didn't end how I thought it should or could have) \\n\\nThen BAM the good fight arrives and yes it sure is...the show gives a great fight as a spin off...probably one of the best yet.\\n\\nIt's early days yet but if it keeps up with the amazing dialogue then we have a winner people.\\n\\nLove the original characters and very keen to see how the new ones develop.\",\"NP\":[[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"wife\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"i\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"fight\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"fight\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"spin\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"amazing\",\"JJ\"],[\"dialogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"winner\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Homeland\",\"reviewText\":\"Do you belong to the kind of people who think they are knowledgeable but in reality they are simple minded who gets manipulated easily by propaganda and untruthful media?\\n\\nDo you believe in political and religious matters without doing enough investigation?\\n\\nDo you suck in checking the reliability of sources?\\n\\nDo you get horny when you hear the term \\\"American Dream\\\"?\\n\\nIf the answer for all the 4 questions is yes, then this series is guaranteed to be great for you. The only problem is that if you belong to this kind of people, you won't know it. Besides, it is clear that the writer of the story didn't do the slightest research which is unneeded due to the nature of most of the series fans.\\n\\nFirst, never in the history of humanity, has Hezbollah and AL-Qaeda worked together. Al-Qaeda existed in the first place to annihilate Hezbollah and their followers. The war that is going on in Syria was most of the time between AL-Qaeda and Hezbollah. The war that took place recently in Lebanon was between AL-Qaeda and Hezbollah. The history between the 2 sides is full with nothing but war. \\n\\nSecond, Hamra street in Lebanon is a beautiful and touristic town. It is not what they showed in this series. Hezbollah control is none in this area, none. Even the areas where Hezbollah has presence are too far away from Hamra. The chance of seeing a gun in this town is too rare. This town is only controlled by Lebanese general security. It's even rare to see a hand fight in this area.\\n\\nThird, Lebanese don't speak Arabic like the rest of the Arabs. That's a known fact to anyone who did a few seconds search on google about this. Lebanon speak an accent which uses informal Arabic, little to none formal Arabic, and a mishmash of English and French which make the Lebanese accent a bit difficult to understand for other Arabs. The accent spoken by the actors who are supposed to be Lebanese in this series is not even close to Lebanese.\\n\\nForth, the Lebanese you showed in the series are not even a close presentation of Lebanese neither in the way they dress, speak, nor look like.\\n\\nIn the end, not every one who liked this series is like I described. So in conclusion, good and enjoyable series to watch during lunch for those who are just looking for adrenaline moments regardless of their beliefs.

Thus, it both has the feel of an old-fashioned sitcom without the dated quality of one. It's actually quite a clever premise: it's a \\\"cop show\\\" but set in the workplace environment. This is a clever move as the show is able to subvert some of the stereotypical police procedural elements while also keeping stuff grounded and relatable by keeping the majority of the antics constrained to the police station.\\n\\nThe cast is talented all across the board. One thing you might find as the show grows is that Andy Samberg will become more subdued in his approach. I say this because as of now he is clearly the \\\"star\\\" of the show and, as such, he's often given a lot of LOUD dialogue -- but this also happened to the Leslie Knope character in \\\"Parks and Recreation,\\\" and she ended up organically evolving into a much smarter and more likable character. I think once Brooklyn Nine-Nine finds its own footing and more firmly establishes its characters, things will settle into place. It's still a bit shaky but it's just the freshman season flaws.

I fear for many it has been over-hyped, or just the high rating on the page leads folks to expect more than the movie is actually trying to sell. What it's selling is extremely well done action, and if you're content with just that then it will deliver in spades.\\n\\nKeanu Reeves plays the retired super-hit-man John Wick. He's pulled back into the world he left behind when the arrogant and ignorant son of a mob boss roughs him up for kicks (it's a little more personal than that, but I don't want to spoil it.) This sends John on a rampage through an underground world of mafia figures and hired killers. It really is that simple.\\n\\nWhile the plot is as bare bones as it gets, there's a surprisingly deep world being built. It's a world in which there is a hotel specifically set up for hired killers to whole up in while they're on the job. It's a world where a body clean up crew is just a phone call away. It's a stylized world to be sure, but it's an intriguing one as well. It also helps that it's populated by some recognizable faces. Just the casting of folks like Ian McShane, Willem Dafoe, and John Leguizamo turns what are fairly thin characters into something that works. Many of the actors bring a certain caliber just by their presence that makes this world work.\\n\\nBut really, you're here for the action. And it's stellar. Firstly there are wonderfully long takes, no rapid cut trickery here. You know exactly what's going on and where everything is. And I personally LOVE the fighting style that John uses. While he appears to be a decent shot, his tactic is to get in close and then pump his target full of bullets. It's actually been a long standing pet peeve of mine that in so many action movies, the bad guys (especially henchmen) go down with a single bullet to some unspecified part of the body. John Wick is a professional, and he takes no chances. Even one of the innumerable body guards is going to get three shots to the gut and two to the head, just so John can be certain that he doesn't have to deal with that person again. It's fast, it's efficient and it's thrilling.\\n\\nThe film loses a little big of steam towards the end. The natural climax of the film happens with about 20 minutes left to go, and the final action scene isn't as thrilling or as poignant as it wants to be. That said it's not a deal breaker, and the action scenes that come before the climax more than make it worth going through the slightly weaker ending.\",\"NP\":[[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"high\",\"JJ\"],[\"rating\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"page\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"selling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ignorant\",\"JJ\"],[\"son\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"mob\",\"NN\"]],[[\"boss\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"rampage\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"underground\",\"JJ\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mafia\",\"NN\"]],[[\"simple\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"deep\",\"JJ\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"hotel\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"job\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"body\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crew\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"phone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"call\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"stylized\",\"JJ\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"intriguing\",\"JJ\"],[\"one\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"casting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"certain\",\"JJ\"],[\"caliber\",\"NN\"]],[[\"presence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"work\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"rapid\",\"JJ\"],[\"cut\",\"NN\"]],[[\"trickery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"fighting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"decent\",\"JJ\"],[\"shot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"target\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"long\",\"JJ\"],[\"standing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pet\",\"NN\"]],[[\"peeve\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mine\",\"NN\"]],[[\"many\",\"JJ\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"single\",\"JJ\"],[\"bullet\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"unspecified\",\"JJ\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"body\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"innumerable\",\"JJ\"],[\"body\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"gut\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"head\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"person\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"steam\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"natural\",\"JJ\"],[\"climax\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"final\",\"JJ\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"deal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"breaker\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"come\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"climax\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Bad Times at the El Royale\",\"reviewText\":\"Great cast, nice shots and promising fundament for the story.

Mike Nichol's tried to do so in his 1970 film, but fell short because of, in this viewer's opinion, the limitation of two hours not being enough time to adapt the novel. I believe the novel is a brilliant commentary on the lunacy of war as Heller saw it, which was ahead of it's time. This dark dramedy does an exceptional job displaying the satire and insanity that is expressed in the novel. This series has excellent direction, settings, soundtrack, costume and acting. However the cinematography is outstanding as well as the writing of Michod and Davies. All of the actors deliver superlative performances. In particular Abbott, Laurie, Stewart and Pullman stand out. Clooney's limited time in the series as Lieutenant Scheisskopf is worth it. His dialogue delivery, facial expressions and gesticulations are absolutely priceless. The same goes for Chandler as Colonel Cathcart throughout the series. The plot is set during WWII in Italy and revolves around a squadron of bombardier pilots with the central character being Yossarian A.K.A. Yo-Yo. He is the one man that seems to understand how egregious his situation is and the war is in general, pun intended. With the Germans retreating, Yo-Yo figures out that by convalescence he can get out of completing his required flight missions which starts out at 19. This is where Catch-22, which was coined by Heller, comes into play. Catch-22 is a diabolical military rule which states that if a man declares he is insane to get out of duty, well then he must be a sane man because you'd have to be crazy to fly bombardier missions to begin with therefore you are sane and you can't be discharged from duty. Essentially for all you readers that are unfamiliar with the phrase, it is a situation that is impossible to get out of. To top this off the maniacal Cathcart keeps upping the number of missions needed to complete one's duty and it always happens when a man is just a few missions from completing his duty. The series has all of the main characters from the novel; Yo-Yo, Cathcart, de Coverley, Scheisskopf, Milo, Aardvark, Nurse Duckett, Major Major Major ( that's not a typo) and more. The series does a marvelous job examining certain characters such as de Coverley as he navigates the war in the background as sort of a neutral character who hides in plain sight, Mess Officer Milo as he escapes flying missions by becoming a war profiteer, Major Major Major Major as he gets by solely because of having a name that was given to him as a practical joke by his father and Nurse Duckett who is on Yo-Yo's side but sees right through him.. As the missions grow from 19 to 25 to 30 to 55 the stakes get higher for Yo-Yo as he continues to try to find ways to beat the bureaucracy such as flying 11 missions quickly and handing in paperwork all at once before the missions can be raised again. We see the men during down time tying to enjoy a normal life during the most sinister of times. The series scrutinizes what lengths men are pushed to during the stress of war time and what lengths they'll go to in order to rid themselves of the madness. There are so many memorable quotes and scenes in the series. If I had to choose a quote it is when Scheisskopf asks a stenographer to read me back what I just said and the stenographer replies, \\\"Read me back what I just said\\\". The look on Scheisskopf's face is uproarious. My favorite scene would have to be when Cathcart is berating the squadron on how they missed this huge target in Rome only to have one of the men point out that it is Vatican City.

I prefer to watch a particular movie or show and move on. However, I find my self writing this comment and while doing that I realize that it is only a show like Dexter, or these few that are equally of quality to this one.\\n\\nTo see Michal C. Hall return on the screen every episode is just something I'm totally looking out for. This is from the moment when I first watched the show. Now I'm going to be honest, I live in the Netherlands and so Showtime is not available here. One of our national networks told us that they have plans to broadcast Dexter this year starting with season one. I keep following Dexter on the net through the so inevitable but unfortunately called \\\"illegal\\\" ways. This I'm doing since the end of season two when my brother told me about the show. By that time, no one of my friends ever heard of this show. At the end of season three, we kind of where making appointments with my friends to specifically watch a particular episode of Dexter. Me myself most of the times am getting up at 4 am just to be first to download it when ever it is released. Then later on the day, have some good time with my friends enjoying this magnificent show. Even two of my girlfriends love the show, and these are not really the girls where you would expect it from. Embrace the effect of Dexter on my life, my friends their lives all our lives. Or like the tag line says, \\\"Takes life. Seriously\\\" It sure as hell took my life, seriously!\\n\\nTo go a little deeper on why I think it is such a great show has the following reasons. Personally I just like crime and police shows. As long as it is no where like CSI Miami, CSI NY or CSI season 258. That I don't like. I like a show to be original, a show with a sick twist even better. For instance, \\\"Californication\\\" in my opinion, Original, nice and has in a way that same sick twist like Dexter has. (alright both made by Showtime, true) If you like the show in a way I do then you might agree that after a few episodes you connect with Dexter in way like it is normal. Some regular guy from two blocks further who has a good job at where ever that maybe.\\n\\nIt is the possibility that it could be your friend, your neighbour or maybe a family member. Of course, this has all to do with the personal view you get from Dexter. Any other serial killer in any other show most of the times only share there motives for slaughtering there number of people. For instance, there are not many nice serial killers in the show \\\"Criminal Minds\\\".\\n\\nSo I guess it is his lovely wife Rita, played far beyond excellent by Julie Benz or his \\\"damaged-in-her-own-way\\\" sister Debra played by his real life wife, Jennifer Carpenter. \\n\\nThe smaller but surely not lesser roles like Vince Masuka, Angel Batista and his other colleagues which make the series so complete. It is that doing his all day routines with out really pulling attention of anyone in his surroundings of who he really is. The idea that it actually could be possible to kill bad people, slaughter them, enjoy it and still get away with it. \\n\\nThe series are original, one of a kind... \\\"A Showtime masterpiece\\\"\",\"NP\":[[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"guy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"particular\",\"JJ\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"move\",\"NN\"]],[[\"self\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"comment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"quality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"one\",\"NN\"]],[[\"return\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"screen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"something\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"moment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"year\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Dexter\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brother\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"one\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"end\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"kind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"particular\",\"JJ\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"day\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"magnificent\",\"JJ\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"effect\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"tag\",\"NN\"]],[[\"line\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hell\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"little\",\"JJ\"],[\"deeper\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"police\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"sick\",\"JJ\"],[\"twist\",\"NN\"]],[[\"instance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Californication\",\"NN\"]],[[\"opinion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"sick\",\"JJ\"],[\"twist\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Some\",\"DT\"],[\"regular\",\"JJ\"],[\"guy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"job\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"possibility\",\"NN\"]],[[\"friend\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"family\",\"NN\"]],[[\"member\",\"NN\"]],[[\"course\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"personal\",\"JJ\"],[\"view\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Any\",\"DT\"],[\"other\",\"JJ\"],[\"serial\",\"JJ\"],[\"killer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"other\",\"JJ\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"share\",\"NN\"]],[[\"number\",\"NN\"]],[[\"instance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"lovely\",\"JJ\"],[\"wife\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sister\",\"NN\"]],[[\"real\",\"JJ\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"wife\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"all\",\"DT\"],[\"day\",\"NN\"]],[[\"attention\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"idea\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"kind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"masterpiece\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Fargo\",\"reviewText\":\"What the **** did I just spent two evenings watching??

Sharp stylish, flashy television is something the yanks do wonderfully but Britain is hopeless at it.

Complete with electrifying action, beautiful cinematography, a pulsating score and a great sense of humour, the film is pretty much as purely joyful as action thrillers get, and proves two hours of brilliant entertainment.\\n\\nBefore I get into all of that, though, one of the greatest things about this franchise is just how simplistic it is. You may have seen John Wick and John Wick: Chapter 2, you may not have done. Going into this third film, however, it's all pretty irrelevant, and while the first two films are certainly worth your time, absolutely anybody can go and watch this movie without any prior knowledge, and simply sit back and watch the fireworks.\\n\\nThe plot is effectively laid out for you in the first ninety seconds of the movie. John Wick is excommunicated, and there's a $14m bounty on his head. That's it. Following that brief bit of exposition are two hours of beautifully simple yet endlessly entertaining action, and while the film does keep you engrossed with its sense of mystery and intrigue surrounding this world of allegiances and deception, it's the thrill of the chase that really matters.\\n\\nIn that, there's almost never a moment where storytelling takes precedence over action thrills, with the movie bursting into life by way of an exhilarating opening act. However, much like the first two films, not every moment is fighting and shootouts, with the mystery, the tension and the intrigue all playing a part as John Wick encounters numerous people from his past in all manner of different scenarios.\\n\\nThere are moments in its middle portion that do drag a little more than others, and where the story perhaps gets a little self-indulgent, however there's no denying just how slick and purely entertaining a thriller this is regardless.\\n\\nOf course, the action itself is brilliant as well. The opening act is astonishing, filled to the brim with insane action that features seamless fight choreography, brilliant camerawork and a fantastic sense of self-awareness that allows you to laugh at the most ridiculous moments. From then on, the film continues to burst into life with mad, energetic and dazzling action sequences again and again, only furthering the sheer entertainment appeal of the whole affair.\\n\\nAlso, there's no getting away from just how good-looking a movie this is. The camerawork in the fight sequences is certainly excellent, but it's the film's kaleidoscopic colour pallette and slick cinematography that makes it a feast for the eyes, pulling off the style of a pure pulp thriller in brilliant fashion once again, and with a pulsating, intense score playing throughout to boot, you'll definitely be on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.\\n\\nAll in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum isn't much different from the previous two movies. It isn't the world's most intricate or intelligent thriller. However, with brilliant energy, dazzling visuals, stunning action and an invaluable sense of fun, absolutely none of that matters, and it instead proves a solidly entertaining, manic and dizzyingly joyful thriller throughout.\",\"NP\":[[[\"Chapter\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Parabellum\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"franchise\",\"NN\"]],[[\"unique\",\"JJ\"],[\"appeal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"stunning\",\"JJ\"],[\"fashion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"beautiful\",\"JJ\"],[\"cinematography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"pulsating\",\"NN\"]],[[\"score\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"great\",\"JJ\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"humour\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brilliant\",\"JJ\"],[\"entertainment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"franchise\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Chapter\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"third\",\"JJ\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anybody\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"prior\",\"JJ\"],[\"knowledge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"ninety\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bounty\",\"NN\"]],[[\"head\",\"NN\"]],[[\"that\",\"DT\"],[\"brief\",\"JJ\"],[\"bit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"exposition\",\"NN\"]],[[\"entertaining\",\"JJ\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mystery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intrigue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"deception\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"thrill\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"chase\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"moment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"precedence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bursting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"opening\",\"NN\"]],[[\"act\",\"NN\"]],[[\"every\",\"DT\"],[\"moment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"mystery\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"tension\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"intrigue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"past\",\"NN\"]],[[\"all\",\"DT\"],[\"manner\",\"NN\"]],[[\"middle\",\"JJ\"],[\"portion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"denying\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"thriller\",\"NN\"]],[[\"course\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"opening\",\"NN\"]],[[\"act\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"brim\",\"NN\"]],[[\"insane\",\"JJ\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fight\",\"NN\"]],[[\"choreography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brilliant\",\"JJ\"],[\"camerawork\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"fantastic\",\"JJ\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"self-awareness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"dazzling\",\"JJ\"],[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sheer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"entertainment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"appeal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"whole\",\"JJ\"],[\"affair\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"movie\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"camerawork\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"fight\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"film\",\"NN\"]],[[\"kaleidoscopic\",\"NN\"]],[[\"colour\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pallette\",\"NN\"]],[[\"slick\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cinematography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"feast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"style\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"pure\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pulp\",\"NN\"]],[[\"thriller\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brilliant\",\"JJ\"],[\"fashion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"pulsating\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intense\",\"JJ\"],[\"score\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"edge\",\"NN\"]],[[\"seat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Chapter\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Parabellum\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"intelligent\",\"JJ\"],[\"thriller\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brilliant\",\"JJ\"],[\"energy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"action\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"invaluable\",\"JJ\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fun\",\"NN\"]],[[\"none\",\"NN\"]],[[\"joyful\",\"JJ\"],[\"thriller\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Breaking Bad\",\"reviewText\":\"From season 1 to season 5, Breaking Bad is just perfect all over...

Despite this all of the characters are amazing as they are all likable and have incredible chemistry which makes this show one you should watch.\\n\\nIt mainly follows Jake Peralta who is a guy who loves his work, is incredibly immature and usually takes inspiration from action films like Die Hard whilst on a case. The show always follows the other characters in engaging and hilarious plot lines which also shows off different traits and experiences of their separate characters. \\n\\nWhilst it is an amazing show, it has it's flaws such as every finale has started to end in mostly the same way and the first couple of episodes of the next series will be centred around this one thing. As with any show there are some episodes that are not as good as the others, however after 4 seasons there are no seriously bad episodes so that is great.\\n\\nOne last issue is that there is a duo in the precinct called Hitchcock and Scully who exist solely to be gross out characters (Which I don't particularly mind) and are essentially the exact same character, however they can be really funny and they do have characteristics even though they have the least amount of character development than anyone else in the show. \\n\\nSo in conclusion this is an exceptional show which has a wide range of lovable characters and many different kinds of humour and jokes which are usually very funny. If you have seen a trailer for this show and it expect it to be another of those sitcom comedies like, New girl and The Big Bang Theory, it actually has a much higher level of quality then those two.

You might like it \\\" \\n\\nSo I took it home and watched the first episode and like several people have said beforehand watching it on DVD instead of TV transmission is something of a blessing because the opening episode is heavy going as it introduces the characters . Thankfully by the end of the second episode I was hooked as I began to understand the conflict between characters and recognised where the plot strands were heading \\n\\nDEADWOOD is like I said produced by HBO the cable company which allows \\\" adult content \\\" in their shows and to be honest if it was made by a mainstream American TV company I wouldn't have watched the show because we'd be watching one of those dire PG western series something like THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE with better cinematography . The selling point of the show is that it's brutal adult drama set in the wild west and if you enjoyed Roy Rogers , John Wayne and Gary Cooper strutting their stuff in those old monochrome movies it doesn't necessarily mean you'll enjoy this same as if you enjoyed THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION doesn't mean you'll enjoy OZ .\\n\\nAnd speaking of HBO's classic prison drama if DEADWOOD resembles anything it resembles OZ the way the characters interact as they try to get one over on each other . When watching OZ I used to rub my hands in sadistic glee whenever the likes of Adebisi , Schillinger and O'Reilly were on screen because you just knew something nasty was going to happen . It's the same here when AL Swearengen makes an appearance like the scene where he asks his cleaner if she's cleaned up properly: \\n\\n\\\" Did you get get the blood off the floor ? \\\" \\n\\n\\\" I scrubbed real hard \\\" \\n\\n\\\" I didn't f--kin' ask you if you scrubbed real hard I asked you if you got the f--kin' blood off the floor ? \\\" Inspects blood stain \\\" Get me the f--kin' bucket and brush . If I want something f--kin' done in this town I have to f--kin' do it myself \\\" \\n\\nDid I mention this scene shows Al at his most merciful and compasionate ? The way Swearengen is written is and played really makes this series stand out though I do confess my favourite plot strand of the first series was the one that revolved around a couple of teenage con artists who met a sticky end at the fists of Cy Tolliver .\\n\\nDespite being compelling DEADWOOD is an acquired taste . No doubt history students will point out that while Swearengen , Seth Bullock , Sol Star , Calamity Jane etc existed other major characters like Alma Garret and Doc Cochran didn't so many of the plot strands and situations of the show are pure invention on the part of the writers and producers but did anyone market DEADWOOD as being 100% accurate ? One slight problem I did have was that one of the subplots featuring a child survivor of a massacre , a young girl called Sofia Metz , remains unresolved at the end of the first series .

In the case of Too Old To Die Young NWR has gone too far. He's high on his own supply.\\n\\nNWR's slow methodical approach to story telling is a great change of pace for the A.D.D. generation in Hollywood and he brings that and his dark aesthetic to the small screen. The cinematography is great, the score is awesome, the casting works for the most part, but where this dark tale fails is in it's story. The show starts with some promise and gives way for the slightest bit of hope that as it drags along it will pick up somewhere and deliver, unfortunately, it does not. TOTDY fails to justify the run times of the episodes; dragging out a basic story muddled in symbolism to approx. 13 hours.\\n\\nFar too often in NWR films the protagonist is given little backstory and is usually presented as a blank slate for the viewer to project him or herself onto. The main characters are underdeveloped here yet again. We honestly learn more about side characters and their day to day lives than the leads. The show made the mistake of misleading viewers into thinking Miles Teller was the sole lead when it's more or less a trinity of Yaritza, Jesus, and Martin (Teller).

He brings that same sense of style and flare to the El Royale. The film looks great and hooks you in from the start. If I had to describe the feel, I'd say it's Tarantino meets Hitchcock. It takes its time introducing and fleshing out the characters while unfolding the plot in a way that's always interesting. The revelations are put together with a ton of craft and it has a great mix of dark comedy. A little long towards the end but the pay off is worth it.\\n\\nSpeaking of characters, the cast is fantastic. Jon Hamm brings his 'Mad Men' charm along with a dash of great comedic timing. Jeff Bridges gives one of his best roles since 'True Grit' and he has great chemistry with Cynthia Erivo. Their scenes together are some of the best and this is sure to be a breakout role for her. Same goes for Lewis Pullman who plays the Hotel everything(you'll get the joke when you see it) as he delivers a purposefully awkward but strong character. Chris Hemsworth gives us something that we haven't seen from him before but the less said about that, the better. Dakota Johnson and Cailee Spaeny were a mixed bag for me.

Indeed, the conflicting elements to the central characters which makes the show so great would unlikely be pulled off without actors of the calibre of Claire Danes, Damian Lewis, Mandy Patinkin and Morena Baccarin (also particular kudos to the daughter played by Morgan Saylor - one to watch out for in the future). Not only do you watch these characters go through some truly weird and strained circumstances, you really feel it too. The story also has a depth and complexity to it that has only been seen in shows such as The Wire, Lost, The Sopranos and Generation Kill. There are no plot holes that distract from the often quite tense narrative and despite what you think of the overall subject I would be surprised if this show didn't totally suck you in. This is a very real, well thought out and well executed show. Two big thumbs up to everyone involved.

Much has been made of the profanity, but after watching each season about four times through, the profanity is one of the show's least memorable qualities.

It not only communicates the sensationalized myth of the need for fear, but it also depicts public officials as sinister, self- righteous villains for whom if violence could ever be justified, it would be justified against the characters portrayed as protagonists in this show.\",\"NP\":[[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"acting\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"writing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"only\",\"JJ\"],[\"reason\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"capacity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"air\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"positive\",\"JJ\"],[\"view\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"humanity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"government\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"criminal\",\"JJ\"],[\"justice\",\"NN\"]],[[\"system\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"sensationalized\",\"JJ\"],[\"myth\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"need\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fear\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sinister\",\"NN\"]],[[\"violence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Criminal Minds\",\"reviewText\":\"I do not need to go on about how the show is - you contributors with your excellent analysis have all shed light on various aspects of the show.

There are many movies like this one, shoot em up type of things. The expendables was one of them, and from the previous 2 films, this one did not excite. All 3 of them in my opinion are terrible. Many of these types of movies are terrible, with the plot being too clich\\u00e9 or unable to make sense with, or it is too unrealistic. This movie was much different.\\n\\nWhen I first saw the trailer I was happy to see Keanu Reeves back, for he had not come out with many things since the Matrix. Then I realized what the movie consisted of and my emotions changed quick. I went to the theater hoping it was at least better than the expendables or any other movie that is like that, but it was entirely different. The plot i admit was clich\\u00e9, and the fact that John Wick could kill that many people and survive is a little ridiculous, but the movie is very enjoyable! The actions scenes are amazing and very fun to watch. Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role, and this is probably going to be a reboot to his career. He does not disappoint in this movie, in fact, this is in my opinion his best acted movie. If this movie didn't have good acting in it it would not be as good. There are some flaws to the movie as in any other, but I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of the year. \\n\\nThis film is rated R, and for a reason. There are an occasional F bomb, and no sexual themes in it. The movie is rated R for violence. There is some blood spray when people are being shot, or from being beaten. There are also some mature thematic material in the movie involving the death of his wife due to I believe is cancer or some other disease, and the brutal murdering of his dog that was given to him by his wife. Now take note that the movie revolves around the dog and john getting revenge on the people who killed it. I would strongly recommend not showing this movie to anyone under the age of 14.\\n\\nOverall this movie is excellent. It doesn't take much thinking to watch, but definitely excites.

Season three went a little off the rails but it was alright because there was character development and something that seemed to be leading into a decisive, interesting plot. But no.

It's is extremely well shot, well written, and well acted. The show may disappoint some due to it not being as eventful as breaking bad, but, this show has retained a lot of the quality of breaking bad and it manages to work well as a stand alone and separate series. The first season alone gave us great incite and further development of the already great character Mike, set up the basis for the transformation of Jimmy McGill.\\n\\nI loved this show even in its un eventful somewhat filler moments, such as in the beginning of the 5th episode, Jimmy goes from house to house to get new clients and it offers some hilarious moments (personal favorite tony the toilet buddy). Even in its un eventful slower moments the show still managed to keep me interested. The show hasn't quite made Jimmy's full transformation to criminal lawyer Saul but it's set up the characters track to it. Not everyone will he as captivated or pleased as I am, however, if you still have the void left by Breaking Bad better call Saul fills it thanks to the great performances by the cast (Bob Odenkirk, Johnathan Banks, Michael Mckean, and more), the great writing (by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould), and the cinematography is a standout as well.\\n\\nIn conclusion I hope this show continues to grow in further seasons.

A hard, messy burn that I guarantee will lose The Good Wife's dedicated audience--starting with this viewer.\\n\\nI love Christine Baranski as an actress, but Diane Lockhart was a classy woman in the previous series. Here, she is not. And the real tragedy is that she has no worthy co-star to play against. Instead, Baranksi is left twisting in the wind while the other characters scrape to keep up.

However if you want a more in depth look at the causalities of terrorist attacks and the people that devote their lives to preventing them, then Homeland is a show for you.\\n\\nOne thing that has bothered me for years in shows like 24 is the stereotypical views that they promote about the non-traditional Americans such as Muslims. Every single Islamic member that is shown in shows like 24 ends up having some ties to terrorism and is inherently evil. It doesn't stop there though, any deviation of what is thought to be the ideal American lifestyle leads to trouble in such single minded simplistic shows, but I digress.\\n\\nThis is a review about Homeland which is a surprisingly good entertainment. It starts with Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes in an astonishing performance) learning that an American POW has been turned and is now working for a terrorist organization. Later when an American POW, Gunnery Sergeant Nicolas Brody (Damian Lewis), is rescued she starts to think that he may have been the one she was warned about.\\n\\nWIthout any proof or any real probable cause, she opens an investigation and begins tracking his movements to see if anything raises suspicions. Another bothersome thing about many other shows is the way the lead characters of those shows someone has the audacity and ability to flout both federal and state laws without any repercussions. Homeland does not let any of it's characters get off so easy. If any character is in the wrong in any way they are appropriately chastised for it. In addition to Claire Danes and Damian Lewis awards worthy performances, Mandy Patinkin's performance as upper level CIA officer and Carrie Mathison's mentor is phenomenal. \\n\\nNot wanting to give away to much of this amazing plot I will end this review here.

As of this writing, I'm on S03\\/E06, which I think is the most well-written and explosive episodes of the series. It's also one of the most amazing series that I have seen. These seem more like mini-features, with almost a full hour of drama. By the time I started season three, I started saying aloud how I love Peaky Blinders and its characters. They thrive on a combination of excellent storytelling and photography. \\\"Breaking Bad\\\" is the only other series that I know which have become the platinum standard of any series that I know exist. I venture to believe that Blinders beats out Game of Thrones as well. The main reason why Thrones and Bad don't live up to what I've experienced with Blinders? The sheer boldness of how the show compels you to understand and even empathize with people who make a living out of doing just about everything illegal that they could ever muster, in a place where just about everyone seems to be about some kind of illegal activity. The complexities of the characters demand that everyone must sell who they are and I cannot for the life of me, find any character who is a \\\"weak link\\\" to the series. \\n\\nGame of Thrones is a terrific series as was Breaking Bad. Yet GoT has a number of slow moments. Breaking Bad, while rather straightforward regarding the plot, was just somewhat unbelievable when viewed through the lens of real-life probability. Blinders is deeper and more raw, without looking to any sense of patronizing emotions to give a sense of redemption. Blinders takes off the blinders by asking which holds more value, between family, friends, relationships and business transactions. Or, whether money is really what can repay the emotional anguish of those casualties called \\\"relationships.\\\" Blinders has been throwing some really interesting plot twists and I've finally been blown away at where this series is heading. \\n\\nI remember the first season where a young Winston Churchill was introduced, and I feel that was probably the slowest part of the series - even GoT suffered from the need to explain who\\/what was happening, while Breaking Bad simply jumped right into a whirlwind of trouble thrown the way of Mr. White. Stick with this however. These characters have truly embraced their roles and the photography and writing seem to actually have gotten even better. I'm not one to ever have been interested in an emotional investment of series characters but this so far has been my finest emotional investment. The violence sometimes is quite intense. So much so, that my wife stopped watching by the second season. Considering the date in which Blinders is told, I expect that the violence might be rather extreme. \\n\\nPerhaps I'm being unfair in even speaking about GoT and Breaking Bad, two other exemplary shows which made me loyal to their broadcasts. But Blinders keeps raising the production bar like the other two haven't quite done.\",\"NP\":[[[\"television\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"blue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"moon\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"writing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"amazing\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"full\",\"JJ\"],[\"hour\",\"NN\"]],[[\"drama\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"combination\",\"NN\"]],[[\"excellent\",\"JJ\"],[\"storytelling\",\"NN\"]],[[\"photography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"other\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"platinum\",\"JJ\"],[\"standard\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"venture\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"main\",\"JJ\"],[\"reason\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"sheer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"boldness\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"illegal\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"place\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"kind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"illegal\",\"JJ\"],[\"activity\",\"NN\"]],[[\"everyone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"weak\",\"JJ\"],[\"link\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Game\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"terrific\",\"JJ\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"number\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"real-life\",\"JJ\"],[\"probability\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"sense\",\"NN\"]],[[\"redemption\",\"NN\"]],[[\"value\",\"NN\"]],[[\"family\",\"NN\"]],[[\"business\",\"NN\"]],[[\"money\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"emotional\",\"JJ\"],[\"anguish\",\"NN\"]],[[\"interesting\",\"JJ\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"part\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"need\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"whirlwind\",\"NN\"]],[[\"trouble\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Stick\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"photography\",\"NN\"]],[[\"an\",\"DT\"],[\"emotional\",\"JJ\"],[\"investment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"emotional\",\"JJ\"],[\"investment\",\"NN\"]],[[\"The\",\"DT\"],[\"violence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"wife\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"second\",\"JJ\"],[\"season\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"date\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"violence\",\"NN\"]],[[\"unfair\",\"NN\"]],[[\"other\",\"JJ\"],[\"exemplary\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"production\",\"NN\"]],[[\"bar\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Orange Is the New Black\",\"reviewText\":\"One of the most overrated, dull TV shows i have ever seen..\",\"NP\":[[[\"dull\",\"JJ\"],[\"TV\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\",\"reviewText\":\"Who would think of this duo would be the best part of the series.

Betty Cooper played by Lili Reinhart is picture perfect as the innocent blonde virgin vying for her childhood sweetheart Archie Andrews attention and he is also who she wants for her first love. Archie the redhead is played by K.J. Apa and he is not the innocent young teenager that Betty Cooper thinks he is since they grew up together in picturesque Riverdale.\\n\\nThen we have the newly appointed vixen who just arrived in town from New York city, Veronica Lodge played superbly by Camila Mendes. Veronica is living with mother Hermione Lodge played by Marisol Nichols and they were forced to move out of the big apple New York because Hermione's ex- husband has been publicly proclaimed the biggest fraudster in the state of New York. Now Veronica who has always grown up filthy rich in New York comes down from the high clouds in New York city and she realizes now that she must tone down her extravagant spending habits and social climbing to live within hers and her mothers more realistic means in Riverdale. Veronica Lodge has found her first true friend in the shy but beautiful Betty Cooper. Veronica is willing to try and expose Betty to the ways and means to trap a man, and also how to get on to the Riverdale High cheerleading squad.\\n\\nOf course Riverdale has all the other characters we grew up loving such as music teacher Ms. Grundy, although in this series Ms. Grundy played by Sarah Habel is very hot and horny. There is also Jughead Jones, Big Moose Mason, Dilton Doiley and Josie and her Pussycats. On top of this young and fresh cast, the producers were smart enough to bring in some more established heart throbs from previous successful drama series such as Luke Perry who plays Archie Andrews father Fred, who is divorced and single and trying hard to run his own construction business. Betty Cooper's parents Alica and Hal Cooper are played by seasoned actors Madchen Amick and Lochlyn Munro.\\n\\nThere are some interesting story lines such as the rich red head Blossom twins who go out on the water in a row boat but only Penelope Blossom returns as apparently her brother fell out of the boat only to be taken away by the swift current. In this series which takes place in 2017 you have characters Big Moose Mason (Cody Kearsley) and Kevin Keller (Casey Cott) enjoying each others company as any two gay lovers would in today's more realistic society. I found the varying story lines and abundance of characters from the original animated books and Saturday morning cartoons quite enjoyable. Kudos to the writers, directors and producers who took the risk in blending characters and a small town atmosphere like Riverdale from a simpler period in life to the more complex world we live in today.\\n\\nI give the series pilot an 8 out of 10 rating with much potential.\",\"NP\":[[[\"Impressive\",\"JJ\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"concept\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"picturesque\",\"NN\"]],[[\"small\",\"JJ\"],[\"town\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"original\",\"JJ\"],[\"cartoon\",\"NN\"]],[[\"nostalgia\",\"JJ\"],[\"period\",\"NN\"]],[[\"This\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"small\",\"JJ\"],[\"town\",\"NN\"]],[[\"high\",\"JJ\"],[\"school\",\"NN\"]],[[\"any\",\"DT\"],[\"group\",\"NN\"]],[[\"hormone\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"football\",\"NN\"]],[[\"field\",\"NN\"]],[[\"music\",\"NN\"]],[[\"math\",\"NN\"]],[[\"science\",\"NN\"]],[[\"romance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"air\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"purist\",\"NN\"]],[[\"morning\",\"NN\"]],[[\"cartoon\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"same\",\"JJ\"],[\"name\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"pre-teen\",\"JJ\"],[\"cartoon\",\"NN\"]],[[\"audience\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"innocent\",\"JJ\"],[\"blonde\",\"NN\"]],[[\"virgin\",\"NN\"]],[[\"childhood\",\"NN\"]],[[\"sweetheart\",\"NN\"]],[[\"attention\",\"NN\"]],[[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"love\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"redhead\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"innocent\",\"JJ\"],[\"young\",\"JJ\"],[\"teenager\",\"NN\"]],[[\"vixen\",\"NN\"]],[[\"town\",\"NN\"]],[[\"city\",\"NN\"]],[[\"mother\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"big\",\"JJ\"],[\"apple\",\"NN\"]],[[\"ex-\",\"JJ\"],[\"husband\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fraudster\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"state\",\"NN\"]],[[\"city\",\"NN\"]],[[\"extravagant\",\"JJ\"],[\"spending\",\"NN\"]],[[\"first\",\"JJ\"],[\"true\",\"JJ\"],[\"friend\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"shy\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"man\",\"NN\"]],[[\"squad\",\"NN\"]],[[\"course\",\"NN\"]],[[\"music\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"horny\",\"NN\"]],[[\"top\",\"NN\"]],[[\"fresh\",\"JJ\"],[\"cast\",\"NN\"]],[[\"established\",\"JJ\"],[\"heart\",\"NN\"]],[[\"throbs\",\"NN\"]],[[\"previous\",\"JJ\"],[\"successful\",\"JJ\"],[\"drama\",\"NN\"]],[[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"father\",\"NN\"]],[[\"own\",\"JJ\"],[\"construction\",\"NN\"]],[[\"business\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"interesting\",\"JJ\"],[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"rich\",\"JJ\"],[\"red\",\"JJ\"],[\"head\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"water\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"row\",\"NN\"]],[[\"boat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"brother\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"boat\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"place\",\"NN\"]],[[\"company\",\"NN\"]],[[\"gay\",\"NN\"]],[[\"today\",\"NN\"]],[[\"realistic\",\"JJ\"],[\"society\",\"NN\"]],[[\"story\",\"NN\"]],[[\"abundance\",\"NN\"]],[[\"morning\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"risk\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"small\",\"JJ\"],[\"town\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"simpler\",\"NN\"]],[[\"period\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"complex\",\"JJ\"],[\"world\",\"NN\"]],[[\"today\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"series\",\"NN\"]],[[\"pilot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"rating\",\"NN\"]],[[\"much\",\"JJ\"],[\"potential\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Animal Kingdom\",\"reviewText\":\"I should preface this by saying that I never saw the film on which this is based.

We see both the 'bad' guys who run the drug enterprise and the 'good' guys who try to stop them. We see stick up-men, lawyers, Mayors, police of all sorts, addicts, kids caught in the thick of it all of the character types that could get affected in real life are shown in this show.\\n\\nThere are many well developed characters in the show, that's the thing that I thought the show did really well, the creators never discarded anything from previous seasons, they would sometimes bring back characters the viewer had all but forgot about. \\n\\nYou really can't imagine how hard it was for the writers to write these characters stories in a way that seems relevant to the plot, it would be so convoluted and confusing, but as a credit to David Simon the show is really easy to watch. \\n\\nThe Wire is a fantastic show, some realistic dialogue, masterful character performances (Andre Royo, Wendell Pierce) just to mention a few and the social commentary that invokes lots of thought and opinion, which is what I think Simon would have liked to see. \\n\\nNo episode is boring, no episode is irrelevant, just a good top-notch crime drama of which its originality we may never see the likes of again. Certainly one of my favourite shows of all time.\\n\\nThe Wire= 10\\/10\",\"NP\":[[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"wire\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"month\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"half\",\"JJ\"],[\"period\",\"NN\"]],[[\"Money\",\"NN\"]],[[\"time\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"drug\",\"NN\"]],[[\"scene\",\"NN\"]],[[\"simple\",\"NN\"]],[[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"detailing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"drug\",\"NN\"]],[[\"problem\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"drug\",\"NN\"]],[[\"enterprise\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"thick\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"real\",\"JJ\"],[\"life\",\"NN\"]],[[\"this\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"thing\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"anything\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"viewer\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"way\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"plot\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"credit\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"fantastic\",\"JJ\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]],[[\"some\",\"DT\"],[\"realistic\",\"JJ\"],[\"dialogue\",\"NN\"]],[[\"masterful\",\"JJ\"],[\"character\",\"NN\"]],[[\"the\",\"DT\"],[\"social\",\"JJ\"],[\"commentary\",\"NN\"]],[[\"thought\",\"NN\"]],[[\"opinion\",\"NN\"]],[[\"No\",\"DT\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"no\",\"DT\"],[\"episode\",\"NN\"]],[[\"a\",\"DT\"],[\"good\",\"JJ\"],[\"top-notch\",\"NN\"]],[[\"crime\",\"NN\"]],[[\"drama\",\"NN\"]],[[\"originality\",\"NN\"]],[[\"favourite\",\"NN\"]],[[\"all\",\"DT\"],[\"time\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Gotham\",\"reviewText\":\"Fantastic show with excellent characters!!!\",\"NP\":[[[\"Fantastic\",\"JJ\"],[\"show\",\"NN\"]]]},{\"title\":\"Dexter\",\"reviewText\":\"So Good!

With a rather unusual name, it stuck out like a sore thumb in my recommended section. After finishing the first season, I immediately watched all 6 episodes again. Now that i've finished it twice, I can easily say this is one of the best shows on British TV currently, and can stand toe-to-toe with anything HBO or Showtime has to offer. \\\"Peaky Blinders\\\" touches on a relatively unknown and fascinating portion of British history, and is supported by some of the finest acting I have ever seen on TV. \\n\\nLet me preface this by saying I am an American living in the midwest, so the subject material in this show is something I never knew existed. \\\"Peaky Blinders\\\" takes place in post WW1 Birmingham, which is a time and place I can't say I was very familiar with prior to watching this show. Following a street gang who runs various racketeering and gambling enterprises called the Peaky Blinders, the show unfolds as a northern Irish detective(Sam Neill) comes to Birmingham to sort out a case of stolen machine guns. Things immediately start off with a bang, and rarely let up throughout the 6 hour show. Cillian Murphy plays the stoic, admirable leader of the Peaky Blinders, Tommy Shelby, and is easily one of the most likable anti-heroes I have seen both in TV and film. His character is smart, savvy, and equally ruthless, and despite all this, you find yourself rooting for him throughout the show. This is a phenomena similar to that of The Soprano's Tony Soprano. That is, no matter how many terrible things these characters do, we always find ourselves championing them and hoping for their success. The writers do a fantastic job humanizing these larger-than-life characters, making them relatable to the everyday person. \\n\\nNext, i'll touch on the acting. Sam Neill and Cillian Murphy easily steal the show here, making both their characters incredibly fun to watch. Neill does a fine job with his northern Irish accent, and while not entirely perfect, it is indeed very believable. Cillian Murphy, on the other hand, nearly knocks the very difficult to impersonate \\\"Brummie\\\" accent out of the park. He speaks too slow at times, which is an unfortunate perception of how Birmingham folk speak, but for the most part he does a fine job and continues to show why he is one of the best accent impersonating actors in the biz today. The supporting cast does a solid job at this, too, which adds to the overall immersion of the series. Overall, everyone is believable for the time period, as nobody really knows what the dialect was like post WW1. \\n\\nApart from the fine writing and acting, \\\"Peaky Blinders\\\" has some pretty incredible set pieces as well. Birmingham is well portrayed as the industrial giant it was after the war, and throughout the show you see some period sets that will blow your mind. From narrow, cobblestone streets to steel mills shooting fire into the streets, you really get a feel for what this time may have been like. The city of Birmingham has been leveled since WW2, either by bombs or city planning, so there was some artistic interpretation as to how the city would look. Despite this, the show does a tremendous job building the city from the ground up and making it seem believable. For me, this brought the time period to life and gave me some insight on what the city would have been like in 1919. In \\\"Peaky Blinders\\\", Birmingham is a character all on it's own, which adds a rather interesting backdrop for the actors to work in. \\n\\nWithout giving too much more away about the plot of the show, if you are a fan of crime dramas and period pieces, definitely check this show out. The acting, writing, and special effects are all top notch, despite the show's relatively low budget. The creators definitely chose their spots as far as how to spend the budget they had, and they did an admirable job doing so. The first season must have done quite well over the pond though, as the second season will feature one of my favorite actors currently, Tom Hardy. Don't let the funny name fool you, as \\\"Peaky Blinders\\\" is one of the best shows out right now, period.\\n\\nUPDATE: Season 4 was just released in the states on Netflix, and I had the pleasure of binging it in two days. \\\"Peaky Blinders\\\" is still a fantastic show, even with a slight drop-off in season 3 (in my opinion). Season 4 came back much stronger, though, and I give Knight a lot of credit for keeping this show alive and interesting across all these arcing seasons. Without giving anything away, I must say that Adrien Brody did a fantastic job in season 4 as the primary antagonist which is something I thought season 3 lacked.

James Bond meets the Dukes of Hazard meets Duke Nukem to fulfill every adolescent white trash fantasy imaginable. The show in a nutshell: unlikeable, one-dimensional characters traipse about a small town assaulting people, bedding hot ladies and getting wrapped up in soap opera nonsense. Also, there are bitchin' motorcycles.\\n\\nThe objectification of women in this show makes Entourage look like The Vagina Monologues. A beautiful female agrees to sleep with a creepy stalker in exchange for a few hours of passion with our hero. The girlfriends of the dudes whose asses he whups, the checkout girl at the local grocery, the schoolgirls walking down the street, his ex-wife, his doctor: if there's a remotely attractive woman in frame, one can be sure she's enamored with our mulletted protagonist, Jax. It's later explained that beautiful women are apparently willing to serve in club harems for years in exchange for a slim chance at becoming some specific thug's \\\"old lady\\\". Be still, my beating heart.\\n\\nIn addition to the blatant alpha male wish fulfillment, the show is terribly unrealistic in other ways as well. Despite being a bunch of misogynistic, drunken idiots; gang members are quite capable of running a complex business; hacking into FBI computers; executing (casualty-free) precision military operations; and outwitting \\\"the man\\\" at every turn. Law enforcement ranges from corrupt to ineffectual but for damn sure won't do anything important in this series. Considering that the idyllic small town of Charming, California is more violent and lawless than Ciudad Juarez, one has to wonder why everyday citizens hold gangsters in such high regard. The message here seems to be that policemen making any attempt to do their jobs are just annoying buzz-kills getting in the way of everyone's fun. The audience is meant to identify with the rowdy bikers because, despite being ruthless criminals, all but the obvious bad guys have hearts of gold. And besides, Jax is secretly conflicted about the moral implications of his chosen profession. Perhaps by Season Five he'll have morphed the gang into a hippie commune -- just like daddy wanted.\\n\\nThe acting is passable and production value is decent. If the show could ditch the corny comic relief and introduce some subtlety or complexity or realism, it might be worth watching.

The casting for Peaky Blinders is excellent and 'Tom Hardy is outstanding' his cockney accent and attitude is together funny and scary, along with top hat and cane his appearance is a statement in itself. Tom Hardy is recently becoming my new favourite actor from this and his fantastic performance as Ivan Lock in 'Locke', another accent changing role which he executes flawlessly. Another great performance in this season in particular is that of Sam Neil, who plays Inspector Chester Campbell, A manipulative police inspector with cruel intentions. He is despised by all due to his excellent acting in this role, you forget he is the once loved Dr. Alan Grant in Jurassic Park. Helen McCrory also gives a fantastic purpose to the series and gives a wonderful loving but stern performance, (a woman not to be crossed) with an impressive accent considering her well spoken voice. Not forgetting the Peaky Blinder Mr himself Cillian Murphy gives a attention gripping performance leaving you admire him but yet still fear him. there's nothing the Peaky Blinders wont do to become kings of Birmingham!

The production values are top notch... this looks like another Batman film you'd see in theaters... and the mix of too many bad guys in one movie reminded me a bit of Spiderman 3, but it just worked here. The plot is set up. Everyone is kind of interrelated in this whole mess called Gotham City and we're all waiting with some baited breath not for Batman to arrive, but to see how the bad guys develop around Jim Gordon, who is masterfully played by Ben Mackenzie (who is kind of hot, by the way). One can only guess that, as the series develops, that the mess that is Gotham keeps escalating to a boiling point whereby the caped crusader is truly needed to help Gordon keep Gotham stable.\\n\\nThe bad guys are truly vicious.
